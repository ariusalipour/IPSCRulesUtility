CHAPTER 1: Course Design 
The following general principles of course design list the criteria, responsibilities and restrictions governing Course Designers as the architects of the sport of IPSC shooting. 
1.1 General Principles 
1.1.1 Safety – IPSC matches must be designed, constructed and conducted with due consideration to safety. 
1.1.2 Quality – The value of an IPSC match is determined by the quality of the challenge presented in the course design. Courses of fire must be designed primarily to test a competitor’s IPSC shooting skills, not their physical abilities. 
1.1.3 Balance – Accuracy, Power and Speed are equivalent elements of IPSC shooting, and are expressed in the Latin words "Diligentia, Vis, Celeritas" ("DVC"). A properly balanced course of fire will depend largely upon the nature of the challenges presented therein. However, courses must be designed, and IPSC matches must be conducted in such a way, as to evaluate these elements equally. IPSC Mini Rifle matches are exempt from minimum power considerations (also see Rule 5.6.1). 
1.1.4 Diversity – IPSC shooting challenges are diverse. While it is not necessary to construct new courses for each match, no single course of fire must be repeated to allow its use to be considered a definitive measure of IPSC shooting skills. 
1.1.5 Freestyle – IPSC matches are freestyle. Competitors must be permitted to solve the challenge presented in a freestyle manner. After the Start Signal, courses of fire must not require mandatory reloads nor dictate a shooting position, location or stance, except as specified below. However, conditions may be created, and barriers or other physical limitations may be constructed, to compel a competitor into shooting positions, locations or stances. 
1.1.5.1 Level I and Level II matches are not required to comply strictly with the freestyle requirements or round count limitations (see Section 1.2). 
1.1.5.2 Short Courses and Classifiers may include mandatory reloads and may dictate a shooting position, location and/or stance. When a mandatory reload is required, it must be completed after the competitor shoots at his first target, and before he shoots at his final target. Violations are subject to one procedural penalty. 
1.1.5.3 General Courses and Classifiers may not specify that the weak shoulder is to be used when shooting. 
1.1.5.4 If a written stage briefing specifies that a competitor is required to carry, retain or grasp an object during his attempt at a course of fire, Rule 10.2.2 will apply. 
1.1.5.5 Course Designers may give competitors freedom to await the Start Signal anywhere within the boundaries of a well demarcated firing zone. 
1.1.6 Difficulty – IPSC matches present varied degrees of difficulty. No shooting challenge may be appealed as being prohibitive. This does not apply to non-shooting challenges, which should reasonably allow for differences in competitor's height and physical build. 


1.2 Types of Courses 
IPSC matches may contain the following types of courses of fire: 
1.2.1 General Courses of Fire: 
1.2.1.1 Short Courses – Must not require more than 10 rounds to complete. 
1.2.1.2 Medium Courses – Must not require more than 20 rounds to complete. Course design and construction must not require more than 5 scoring targets to be shot from any single location or view, nor allow a competitor to shoot all targets in the course of fire from any single location or view. 
1.2.1.3 Long Courses – Must not require more than 40 rounds to complete. Course design and construction must not require more than 5 scoring targets to be shot from any single location or view, nor allow a competitor to shoot all targets in the course of fire from any single location or view. 
1.2.1.4 The approved balance for an IPSC sanctioned match is a ratio of 3 Short Courses to 2 Medium Courses to 1 Long Course (see Approved Stage Ratios in Appendix A4). 
1.2.1.5 Option 2 and/or Option 3 rifle ready conditions (see Chapter 8), should not be required for more than 25% of the courses of fire in a match. 
1.2.1.6 The recommended balance for an IPSC Mini Rifle match with regards to target distance is: 30% of all targets to be less than 25 meters, 50% to be between 25 and 40 meters and 20% to be between 40 and 120 meters. 
1.2.1.7 Where the physical dimensions of a range preclude the siting of targets at distances greater than 50 meters, it is recommended that the IPSC Micro Target be used (see Appendix B5). 


1.2.2 Special Courses of Fire: 
1.2.2.1 Classifiers – Courses of fire authorized by a Regional Director and/or IPSC, which are available to competitors seeking a regional and/or international classification. Classifiers must be set up in accordance with these rules and be conducted strictly in accordance with the notes and diagrams accompanying them. Results must be submitted to the authorizing entity in the format required (with the applicable fees, if any), in order for them to be recognized. 
1.2.2.2 Shoot-Off – An event conducted separately from a match. Two eligible competitors simultaneously engage two identical and adjacent target arrays in a process of one or more elimination bouts (see Appendix A3). It is recommended that metal targets be used, and that the final target for each competitor is set so that it overlaps that of the other competitor when struck down, with the winner being the competitor whose target is on the bottom. Each target array must not exceed 12 rounds and each competitor may be required to perform a mandatory reload after shooting at his first target, and before he shoots at his final target. Violations are subject to automatic forfeiture of the bout. 


1.3 IPSC Sanctioning 
1.3.1 Match organizers wishing to receive IPSC sanctioning must comply with the general principles of course design and course construction as well as all other current IPSC Rules and regulations relevant to the discipline. Courses of fire that do not comply with these requirements will not be sanctioned, and must not be publicized or announced as IPSC sanctioned matches. 
1.3.2 Target arrays and presentations or props included in courses of fire submitted to IPSC, but deemed by IPSC to be illogical or impractical, will not be approved (see latest version of the separate Target Array Book). 
1.3.3 The IPSC President, his delegate, or an officer of the Confederation (in that order), may withdraw IPSC sanctioning from a match if, in his or their opinion, a match or any component part thereof: 
1.3.3.1 Contravenes the purpose or spirit of the principles of course design; or 
1.3.3.2 Has been constructed at significant variance to the sanctioned design; or 
1.3.3.3 Is in breach of any current IPSC Rules; or 
1.3.3.4 Is likely to bring the sport of IPSC shooting into disrepute; or 
1.3.3.5 If the provisions of Rule 6.5.1.1 have not been observed. 
1.3.4 IPSC match level requirements and recommendations are specified in Appendix A1. 



CHAPTER 2: Range and Course Construction 
The following general regulations of course construction list the criteria, responsibilities and restrictions applicable to courses of fire in IPSC matches. Course Designers, host organizations and officials are governed by these regulations. 
2.1 General Regulations 
2.1.1 Physical Construction – Safety considerations in the design, physical construction, and stated requirements for any course of fire are the responsibility of the host organization subject to the approval of the Range Master. Reasonable effort must be made to prevent injury to competitors, officials and spectators during the match. Course design should prevent inadvertent unsafe actions wherever possible. Consideration must be given to the operation of any course of fire to provide suitable access for officials supervising the competitors. 
2.1.2 Safe Angles of Fire – Courses of fire must always be constructed taking into account safe angles of fire. Consideration must be given to safe target and frame construction and the angle of any possible ricochets. Where appropriate the physical dimensions and suitability of backstops and side berms must be determined as part of the construction process. Unless otherwise specified, the default maximum muzzle angle is 90 degrees in all directions, measured from the front of the competitor facing directly center downrange. Violations are subject to Rule 10.5.2. 
2.1.2.1 Subject to the direction and approval of the Regional Director, stage(s) or range specific muzzle angles (reduced or increased) may be permitted. Violations are subject to Rule 10.5.2. Full details of the applicable angles and any conditional factors (e.g. a reduced vertical muzzle angle only applies when a finger is inside the trigger guard), should be published in advance of the match and must be included in the written stage briefings (also see Section 2.3). 
2.1.3 Minimum Distances – Whenever metal targets or metal hard cover are used in a course of fire, precautions must be taken so that competitors and Match Officials maintain a minimum distance of 5 meters from them while they are being shot. Where possible, this should be done with physical barriers. If Fault Lines are used to limit the approach to metal targets, they must be placed at least 6 meters from the targets so that the competitor may inadvertently fault the line and still be outside the 5 meter minimum distance (see Rule 10.4.7). Care should also be taken in respect of metal props in the line of fire. 
2.1.4 Target Locations – When a course is constructed to include target locations other than immediately downrange, organizers and officials must protect or restrict surrounding areas to which competitors, officials or spectators have access. Each competitor must be permitted to solve the competitive problem in his own way and must not be hindered by being forced to act in any manner which might cause unsafe action. Targets must be arranged so that shooting at them as presented will not cause competitors to breach safe angles of fire. 
2.1.5 Range Surface – Where possible, the range surface must be prepared prior to the match, and be kept moderately clear of debris during the match, to provide reasonable safety for competitors and officials. Consideration should be given to the possibility of inclement weather and competitor actions. Match Officials may add gravel, sand or other materials to a deteriorated range surface at any time, and such range maintenance actions may not be appealed by competitors. 
2.1.6 Obstacles – Natural or created obstacles in a course of fire should reasonably allow for variations in competitors' height and physical build and should be constructed to provide reasonable safety for all competitors, Match Officials and spectators. 
2.1.7 Common Firing Lines – Courses of fire where multiple competitors are required to fire simultaneously from a common firing line (e.g. Shoot-Off), must provide a minimum of 3 meters of free space between each competitor. 
2.1.8 Target Placement – Care must be taken with the physical placement of a paper target to prevent a "shoot through". 
2.1.8.1 Target placement should be clearly marked on the target stands for target replacement and target stands should be securely fixed or their locations should be clearly marked on the range surface to ensure consistency throughout the entire match. Furthermore, target types should be specified and identified on the target frames or stands prior to the start of the match to ensure that a scoring target is not interchanged with a no-shoot after the match has commenced. 
2.1.8.2 When paper and metal targets are used in close proximity in a course of fire, care must be taken to 
minimize the risk of splatter from metal targets. 
2.1.8.3 When IPSC Poppers are used in a course of fire, care should be taken to ensure that the location or foundation area is prepared to provide consistent operation throughout the match. 
2.1.8.4 Static targets (i.e. those which are not activated), with the exception of the Universal target, must not be presented at an angle greater than 90 degrees from the vertical. 
2.1.9 Berms – All berms are "off limits" to all persons at all times, except when access to them is specifically permitted by a Range Officer (see Section 10.6). 


2.2 Course Construction Criteria 
During the construction of a course of fire, a variety of physical barriers may be used to restrict competitor movement and to provide additional competitive challenges as follows: 
2.2.1 Fault Lines – Competitor movement should preferably be restricted through the use of physical barriers. However, the use of Fault Lines is permitted as follows: 
2.2.1.1 To prevent unsafe and/or unrealistic charging at, or retreat from, targets; 
2.2.1.2 To simulate the use of physical barriers and/or cover; 
2.2.1.3 To define the boundaries of a general shooting area or part thereof. 
2.2.1.4 Fault Lines must be fixed firmly in place, they must rise at least 2 centimeters above ground level, they should be constructed of wood or other rigid materials, and they should be of a consistent color (preferably red), at every COF in a match. Unless used in a continuous manner to define the boundary of a general shooting area, fault lines must be a minimum of 1.5 meters in length, but they are deemed to extend to infinity (also see Rule 4.4.1). 
2.2.1.5 If a COF has a passageway visibly delineated by fault lines and/or a clearly demarcated shooting area, any competitor who takes a shortcut by stepping on the ground outside the passageway and/or shooting area will incur one procedural penalty for each shot fired after beginning the shortcut. 

2.2.2 Not applicable. 
2.2.3 Barriers – Must be constructed in the following manner: 
2.2.3.1 They must be high enough and strong enough to serve the intended purpose. Unless supplemented by a shooting platform or similar, barriers of at least 1.8 meters high are deemed to extend skywards to infinity (also see Rule 10.2.11). 
2.2.3.2 They should include Fault Lines projecting rearward at ground level from the side edges. 


2.2.4 Not applicable. 
2.2.5 Cooper Tunnels – Are tunnels comprised of braced uprights supporting loose overhead materials (e.g. wooden slats), which may fall off when inadvertently dislodged by competitors (see Rule 10.2.5). These tunnels may be constructed to any height, but overhead materials must not be heavy enough to cause injury if they fall. 
2.2.6 Stage Props – Where these items are intended to support a competitor in motion or while shooting targets, they must be constructed with the safety of the competitor and Match Officials as a priority. Provisions must be made to allow Match Officials to safely monitor and control competitor action at all times. Props must be strong enough to withstand use by all competitors. 
2.2.7 Windows and Ports – Must be placed at a height reachable by most competitors, with a sturdy platform being available for use by others, if requested, without penalty. 


2.3 Modifications to Course Construction 
2.3.1 Match Officials may, for any reason, modify the physical construction or stage procedure for a course of fire, provided that such changes are approved in advance by the Range Master. Any such physical changes or additions to a published course of fire should be completed before the stage begins. 
2.3.2 All competitors must be notified of any such changes as soon as possible. As a minimum, they must be notified by the official in charge of the course of fire during the squad briefing. 
2.3.3 If the Range Master approves any such action after the match begins he must either: 
2.3.3.1 Allow the course of fire to continue with the modification affecting only those competitors who have not already completed the stage. If a competitor’s actions caused the change, that competitor must be required to reshoot the revised course of fire, subject to Rule 2.3.4.1; or 
2.3.3.2 If possible, require all competitors to complete the course of fire as revised with all previous attempts removed from the match results. 
2.3.3.3 A competitor who refuses to reshoot a course of fire, under this or any other Section, when so ordered by a Range Officer, will receive a zero score for that stage, irrespective of any previous attempt. 
2.3.4 If the Range Master (in consultation with the Match Director) determines that the physical or procedural change results in a loss of competitive equity and it is impossible for all competitors to attempt the revised stage, or if the stage has been rendered unsuitable or unworkable for any reason, that stage and all associated competitor scores must be deleted from the match. 
2.3.4.1 A competitor who incurred a disqualification in a stage which is subsequently deleted, may be entitled to reinstatement, if the highest level of appeal pursued by the competitor (i.e. the Range Master or the Arbitration Committee, as the case may be), deems that the disqualification was directly attributable to the reasons for the stage being deleted. 
2.3.5 During inclement weather, the Range Master may order that paper targets be fitted with transparent protective covers and/or overhead shelters, and this order is not subject to appeal by competitors (see Rule 6.6.1). Such items must be applied and remain fitted to all affected targets for the same period of time, until the order is rescinded by the Range Master. 
2.3.6 If the Range Master (in consultation with the Match Director) deems that climatic or other conditions have, or are likely to, seriously affect the safety and/or conduct of a match, he may order that all shooting activities be suspended, until he issues a "resume shooting" directive. 


2.4 Safety Areas 
2.4.1 The host organization is responsible for the construction and placement of a sufficient number of Safety Areas for the match. They should be conveniently placed and must be easily identified with signs. 
2.4.2 Safety Areas must include a table with the safe muzzle direction and boundaries clearly shown. If a backstop and/or side walls are included, they must be constructed of materials capable of containing fired rounds. Safety Areas at long gun matches must include sufficient gun racks adjacent to, but not in, the Safety Area for secure muzzle-up storage of rifles. 
2.4.3 Competitors are permitted to use Safety Areas unsupervised for the activities stated below provided they remain within the boundaries of the Safety Area and the firearm is pointed in a safe direction. Violations may be subject to disqualification (see Rule 10.5.1). 
2.4.3.1 Casing, uncasing, and holstering unloaded firearms. 
2.4.3.2 Practice the mounting, drawing, dry firing and re-holstering of unloaded firearms. 
2.4.3.3 Practice the insertion and removal of empty magazines and/or to cycle the action of a firearm. 
2.4.3.4 Conduct inspections, stripping, cleaning, repairs and maintenance of firearms, component parts and other accessories. 

2.4.4 Dummy ammunition and live rounds, whether loose, packaged or contained in magazines or speed loaders, 
must not be handled in a Safety Area under any circumstances (see Rule 10.5.12). 


2.5 Test Firing / Sighting-In Bay 
2.5.1 When available at a match, a test firing bay must be operated under the supervision and control of a Range Officer. 
2.5.2 Competitors may test the operation of their firearm and ammunition, subject to all existing safety rules and any time limits or other restrictions imposed by a Range Officer. 
2.5.3 At Level III or higher long gun matches, approved IPSC paper and metal targets (where possible, electronically indicating or self-resetting), should be available for use by competitors to aid in the sighting-in of their firearms. 

2.6 Vendor Areas 
2.6.1 Vendors (i.e. individuals, corporations and other entities displaying or selling merchandise at an IPSC match) are solely responsible for the safe handling and security of their products and other items in their care, and ensuring they are displayed in a condition that will not endanger any person. Assembled firearms must be deactivated prior to being displayed. 
2.6.2 The Range Master (in consultation with the Match Director) must clearly delineate the vendor area, and he may issue "Acceptable Practice Guidelines" to all vendors, who are responsible for their implementation in respect of their own merchandise. 
2.6.3 Competitors may handle unloaded vendor's firearms while remaining wholly within the vendor areas, provided reasonable care is taken to ensure that the muzzle is not pointed at any person while being handled. 

2.7 Hygiene Areas 
2.7.1 A sufficient number of hygiene areas, with hand cleansing supplies and facilities, should be provided adjacent to lavatories and near the entrance to food service areas. 


CHAPTER 3: Course Information 
3.1 General Regulations 
The competitor is always responsible to safely fulfill the requirements of a course of fire but can only reasonably be expected to do so after verbally or physically receiving the written stage briefing, which must adequately explain the requirements to the competitors. Course information can be broadly divided into the following types: 
3.1.1 Published Courses of Fire – Registered competitors and/or their Regional Directors must be provided with the same course of fire information, within the same notice period, in advance of the match. The information may be provided by physical or electronic means, or by reference to a website (also see Section 2.3). 
3.1.2 Non-Published Courses of Fire – Same as Rule 3.1.1 except that the details for the course of fire are not published beforehand. The course of fire instructions are provided in the written stage briefing. 

3.2 Written Stage Briefings 
3.2.1 A written stage briefing consistent with these rules and approved by the Range Master must be posted at each course of fire prior to commencement of the match. This briefing will take precedence over any course of fire information published or otherwise communicated to competitors in advance of the match, and it must provide the following minimum information: 
• 
Targets (type & number); 

• 
Minimum number of rounds; 

• 
The rifle ready condition; 

• 
Start position; 

• 
Time starts: audible or visual signal; 

• 
Procedure. 


3.2.2 The Range Officer in charge of a course of fire must read out the written stage briefing verbatim to each squad. The Range Officer must visually demonstrate the acceptable Start Position (either by use of a picture or physically) at all match levels. 
3.2.3 The Range Master may modify a written stage briefing at any time for reasons of clarity, consistency or safety (see Section 2.3). 
3.2.4 After the written stage briefing has been read to competitors, and questions arising therefrom have been answered, competitors should be permitted to conduct an orderly inspection ("walkthrough") of the course of fire. The duration of time for the inspection must be stipulated by the Range Officer, and it should be the same for all competitors. If the course of fire includes moving targets or similar items, these should be demonstrated to all competitors for the same duration and frequency. 

3.3 Local, Regional and National Rules 
3.3.1 IPSC matches are governed by the rules applicable to the discipline. Host organizations may not enforce local rules except to comply with legislation or legal precedent in the applicable jurisdiction. Any voluntarily adopted rules that are not in compliance with these rules must not be applied to IPSC matches without the express consent of the Regional Director and the IPSC Executive Council. 


CHAPTER 4: Range Equipment 
4.1 Targets – General Principles 
4.1.1 Only targets approved by the IPSC Assembly and which fully comply with the specifications in Appendices B and C, and frangible targets (see Rule 4.4.1), are to be used for IPSC Mini Rifle matches. 
4.1.1.1 If one or more targets at a match fail to comply exactly with the stated specifications, and if replacement targets of the correct specifications are unavailable, the Range Master must decide whether or not the variance is acceptable for that match, and which provisions of Section 2.3 of these rules will apply, if any. However, the Range Master's decision will only affect the match in progress, and will not serve as a precedent for future matches held at the same location, or for any subsequent use of the subject targets at another match. 
4.1.1.2 There are three sizes of paper targets and two sizes of poppers approved for use in IPSC Mini Rifle matches (see Appendices B and C). IPSC Mini Targets, Micro Targets and Mini Poppers are used to simulate IPSC Targets and Poppers placed at greater distances. The following types and sizes of targets may be included together in the same target array: 
• 
IPSC Targets and IPSC Poppers; or 

• 
IPSC Mini Targets and IPSC Mini Poppers; or 

• 
IPSC Micro Targets and IPSC Mini Poppers; or 

• 
IPSC Targets and IPSC Mini Poppers; or 

• 
IPSC Mini Targets and IPSC Poppers; or 

• 
IPSC Micro Targets and IPSC Poppers. 

The following types and sizes of targets must not be included together in the same target array: 

• 
IPSC Targets and IPSC Mini Targets; or 

• 
IPSC Targets and IPSC Micro Targets; or 

• 
IPSC Mini Targets and IPSC Micro Targets; or 

• 
IPSC Poppers and IPSC Mini Poppers. 


4.1.2 Scoring targets used in all IPSC matches must be of a single color, as follows: 
4.1.2.1 The scoring area of the IPSC Target, Mini Target and Micro Target must be tan colored, except where the Range Master deems that a lack of contrast with the surrounding area or background necessitates that a different color be used. 
4.1.2.2 The entire front of scoring metal or other non-paper targets must be painted a single color, preferably white. 
4.1.3 No-shoots must be clearly marked with a conspicuous "X" or be of a single, unique color different from scoring targets throughout a match. Paper and metal no-shoots may be of different colors in a match provided that the chosen color is consistent for all no-shoots of the same material (i.e. if metal no-shoots are yellow, they must all be yellow and if paper no-shoots are white, they must all be white in a match or tournament). 
4.1.4 Targets used in a course of fire may be partially or wholly hidden through the use of hard or soft cover, as follows: 
4.1.4.1 Cover provided to hide all or a portion of a target will be considered hard cover. When possible hard cover should not be simulated but constructed using impenetrable materials (see Rule 2.1.3). Whole paper targets must not be used solely as hard cover. 
4.1.4.2 Cover provided merely to obscure targets is considered soft cover. Shots which have passed through soft cover and which strike a scoring target will score. Shots that have passed through soft cover before hitting a no-shoot will be penalized. All scoring zones on targets obscured by soft cover must be left wholly intact. Targets obscured by soft cover must either be visible through the soft cover or at least a portion of the affected target(s) must be visible from around the soft cover. 
4.1.5 Declaring a single, intact target to represent two or more targets by use of tape, paint or any other means and/or attaching a Mini or Micro Target to a full size target is prohibited. 

4.1.6 Only IPSC targets, and mechanically or electrically operated devices, can be used to activate moving targets. 


4.2 IPSC Approved Rifle Targets – Paper 
4.2.1 There are four paper targets approved for use in IPSC Mini Rifle matches (see Appendix B). 
4.2.2 Paper targets must have scoring lines and 0.5 cm (Mini and Micro Targets 0.3 cm) non-scoring borders clearly marked on the front of the target. However, scoring lines and non-scoring borders should not be visible beyond a distance of 10 meters. 
4.2.2.1 The front of paper no-shoots must include a sufficiently distinguishable non-scoring border. In the absence of perforations or other suitable markings, the Range Master must ensure that all affected no-shoots have a replacement 0.5 cm (Mini and Micro Targets 0.3 cm) non-scoring border drawn or fitted thereon. 
4.2.3 When the scoring area of a paper target is to be partially hidden, Course Designers must simulate hard cover in one of the following ways: 
4.2.3.1 By actually hiding a portion of the target (see Rule 4.1.4.1); or 
4.2.3.2 By physically cutting targets from edge to edge to remove the portion deemed to be hidden by hard cover. Such targets must be fitted with a replacement 0.5 cm (Mini and Micro Targets 0.3 cm) non-scoring border, which must extend the full width of the edge of the cut scoring area (see Rule 4.2.2); or 
4.2.3.3 By painting or taping with a sharply defined boundary the portion of the target deemed to be hidden by hard cover with a single and visibly contrasting color. 
4.2.3.4 When paper targets are partially hidden, physically cut, painted and/or taped, at least a portion of all scoring zones must remain visible. 
4.2.4 Hard cover (and overlapping no-shoots) must not completely hide the A zone on a partially hidden paper target. 


4.3 IPSC Approved Rifle Targets – Metal 
4.3.1 General Rules 
4.3.1.1 Metal targets and no-shoots which can accidentally turn edge-on or sideways when hit are expressly prohibited. Using them may result in withdrawal of IPSC sanction. 
4.3.1.2 Metal targets and no-shoots which a Range Officer deems have fallen or overturned due to being hit on the apparatus supporting them, or for any other accidental reason (e.g. wind action, a ricochet, etc.), will be treated as range equipment failure (see Rule 4.6.1). 
4.3.1.3 Metal targets and no-shoots do not have a non-scoring border. 
4.3.1.4 Metal targets and no-shoots must be shot and fall, overturn or self-indicate to score. 


4.3.2 IPSC Poppers 
4.3.2.1 IPSC Poppers and IPSC Mini Poppers are both approved metal targets designed to recognize power, and must be calibrated as specified in Appendix C1. 

4.3.3 IPSC Plates 
4.3.3.1 Metal plates of various sizes may be used (see Appendix C3). Metal targets in the general size and shape of authorized paper targets may also be used. 
4.3.3.2 Metal plates do not recognize power and are not subject to calibration or calibration challenges. If a metal plate has been adequately and directly hit (i.e. with a full bullet diameter) but it fails to fall or overturn, a Range Officer may declare range equipment failure and order the competitor to reshoot the course of fire, after the faulty plate has been rectified. 
4.3.3.3 Metal plates which fail to fall or overturn when initially hit, but which fall or overturn when hit 
with a subsequent shot, are not subject to a reshoot. 


4.3.4 No-Shoots 
4.3.4.1 Metal no-shoot poppers and plates, must be shot and fall, overturn or self-indicate to score. If hit they should be repainted during the scoring process. 
4.3.4.2 Metal no-shoots in the general size and shape of authorized paper targets may be used. 
4.4 Frangible Targets 
4.4.1 Frangible targets, such as tiles, may be used as scoring targets, but not as no-shoots, in IPSC Mini Rifle matches. Clay pigeons are not authorized targets for IPSC Mini Rifle matches. 
4.5 Rearrangement of Range Equipment or Surface 
4.5.1 The competitor must not interfere with the range surface, natural foliage, constructions, props or other range equipment (including targets, target stands and target activators) at any time. Violations may incur one procedural penalty per occurrence at the discretion of the Range Officer. 
4.5.2 The competitor may request that Match Officials take corrective actions to ensure consistency in respect of the range surface, the presentation of targets and/or any other matter. The Range Master will have final authority concerning all such requests. 
4.6 Range Equipment Failure and Other Issues 
4.6.1 Range equipment must present the challenge fairly and equitably to all competitors. Range equipment failure includes, but is not limited to, the displacement of paper targets, the premature activation of metal or moving targets, the malfunction of mechanically or electrically operated equipment, and the failure of props such as openings, ports, and barriers. 
4.6.1.1 The declaration and/or use of any firearm as range equipment is prohibited. 
4.6.2 A competitor who is unable to complete a course of fire due to range equipment failure, or if a metal or moving target was not reset prior to his attempt at a course of fire, must be required to reshoot the course of fire after corrective actions have been taken. 

4.6.2.1 Unrestored paper targets are not range equipment failure (see Rule 9.1.4). 
4.6.2.2 If a Range Master deems that one or more targets in a course of fire are faulty and/or have been presented in a manner significantly different to earlier presentations, he may offer a reshoot to the affected competitor(s). 
4.6.3 Chronic malfunction of equipment in a course of fire may result in the removal of that stage from the match results (see Rule 2.3.4). 
CHAPTER 5: Competitor Equipment 
5.1  Firearms  
5.1.1  Firearms are regulated by Divisions (see Appendix D), but courses of fire must remain consistent for all Divisions.  
5.1.2  There is a mandatory .22LR caliber for rifles used in IPSC Mini Rifle matches.  
5.1.3  Sights  
Types of sights identified by IPSC are:  
5.1.3.1  "Open sights" are aiming devices fitted to a firearm which do not use electronic circuitry and/or lenses. Fiber-optic inserts are deemed not to be lenses.  
5.1.3.2  "Optical/electronic sights" are aiming devices (including flashlights) fitted to a firearm which use electronic circuitry and/or lenses.  
5.1.3.3  The Range Master is the final authority in respect of the classification of any sights used in an IPSC match and/or their compliance with these rules, including the Divisions in Appendix D.  
5.1.4  Unless required by a Division (see Appendix D), there is no restriction on the trigger pull weight of a firearm, but the trigger mechanism must, at all times, function safely.  
5.1.5  Triggers and/or trigger shoes that extend beyond the width of the trigger guard are expressly prohibited. However, rifles fitted with "winter triggers/guards" may be used in this mode, provided that this fitting was designed, manufactured and provided as part of the rifle and only when the particular climate or weather conditions dictate their use.  
5.1.6  Firearms must be serviceable and safe. Range Officers may demand examination of a competitor’s firearm or allied equipment, at any time, to check they are functioning safely. If any such item is declared unserviceable or unsafe by a Range Officer, it must be withdrawn from the match until the item is repaired to the satisfaction of the Range Master (also see Rule 5.7.5).  
5.1.7  Competitors must use the same firearm and type of sights for all courses of fire in a match. However, in the event that a competitor’s original firearm and/or sights become unserviceable or unsafe during a match, the competitor must, before using a substitute firearm and/or sights, seek permission from the Range Master who may approve the substitution provided he is satisfied:  
5.1.7.1  The substitute firearm satisfies the requirements of the relevant Division and is of the same type, action and caliber and is fitted with the same type of sights; and  
5.1.7.2  In using the substitute firearm the competitor will not gain an advantage.  
5.1.8  A competitor who substitutes or significantly modifies a firearm and/or sights during a match without the prior approval of the Range Master will be subject to the provisions of Rule 10.6.1.  
5.1.8.1  The mounting or detaching of a magwell, barricade stop or vertical front grip is not considered a significant modification of a firearm.  
5.1.9  A competitor must never use or wear on his person more than one firearm during a course of fire (see Rule 10.5.7).  
5.1.10  The rifle must be fitted with a stock enabling it to be fired from the shoulder (see Rule 10.5.15).  
5.1.11  Rifles offering only "burst" and/or fully automatic operation (i.e. whereby more than discharged on a single pull or activation of the trigger) are prohibited (see Rule 10.5.15).  one round  can be  
5.1.12  Combination guns offering an additional barrel, or barrels, that is not a conventional rifle barrel (e.g. a rifle and shotgun combination), are prohibited.  

5.2 Carry and Storage and Competitor Equipment 
5.2.1 Carry and Storage – Except when within the boundaries of a Safety Area, or when under the supervision and direct command of a Range Officer, long guns must be unloaded and held, shouldered or slung (or placed in a rack), with the muzzle pointed skywards. Long guns placed in a slip or case are not required to be pointed skywards. Failure to comply may be subject to the provisions of Rule 10.5.1. The action may be open or closed, but a chamber safety flag must be fitted at all times when the firearm is not in use. Detachable magazines must be removed. Violations will incur a warning for the first occurrence, but will be subject to Rule 10.5.1 for subsequent occurrences in the same match. 
5.2.1.1 Competitors arriving at an IPSC match in possession of a loaded firearm must immediately report to a Range Officer, who will supervise unloading of the firearm. Competitors failing to comply may be subject to Rule 10.5.13. 
5.2.1.2 Within the provisions of Rule 5.2.1 no ammunition of any kind is permitted on the gun, or in clips or loops fitted to the gun, or to a sling fitted to the gun except when under the supervision of, and in response to a direct instruction issued by a Range Officer. 
5.2.2 Not applicable. 
5.2.3 The use of shooting sticks, sandbags, tripods and similar, or any stability improving device attached to the firearm by means of straps or tape, is prohibited. 
5.2.4 Ammunition and speed loaders must be carried or worn on the competitor or mounted to the rifle in safely designed pouches, pockets or other suitable retention devices, unless otherwise specified in the written stage briefing. 
5.3 Appropriate Dress 
5.3.1 The use of camouflage or other similar types of military or police garments other than by competitors who are law enforcement or military personnel is discouraged. The Match Director will be the final authority in respect of what garments must not be worn by competitors. 
5.4 Eye and Ear Protection 
5.4.1 All persons are warned that the correct use of adequate eye and ear protection is in their own interest and of paramount importance to prevent injury to vision and hearing. It is strongly recommended that eye and ear protection be worn at all times by all persons while on the range premises. 
5.4.2 Host organizations may require the use of such protection by all persons, as a condition of attendance and while present on the range premises. If so, Match Officials must make every reasonable effort to ensure that all persons wear adequate protection. 
5.4.3 If a Range Officer notices that a competitor has lost or displaced their eye or ear protection during a course of fire, or has commenced a course of fire without them, the Range Officer must immediately stop the competitor who will be required to reshoot the course of fire after the protective devices have been restored. 
5.4.4 A competitor who inadvertently loses eye or ear protection during a course of fire, or commences a course of fire without them, is entitled to stop, point their firearm in a safe direction and indicate the problem to the Range Officer, in which case the provisions of the previous rule will apply. 
5.4.5 Any attempt to gain a reshoot or advantage by removing eye and/or ear protection during a course of fire will be considered unsportsmanlike conduct (see Rule 10.6.2). 
5.4.6 If a Range Officer deems that a competitor about to make an attempt at a course of fire is wearing inadequate eye or ear protection, the Range Officer may order the competitor to rectify the situation before allowing the competitor to continue. The Range Master is the final authority on this matter. 
5.5 Ammunition and Related Equipment 
5.5.1 Competitors at an IPSC match are solely and personally responsible for the safety of all and any ammunition, which they bring to the match. Neither IPSC nor any IPSC Officers, nor any organization affiliated to IPSC, nor the officers of any organization affiliated to IPSC accepts any responsibility whatsoever in this regard, nor in respect of any loss, damage, accident, injury or death suffered by any person or entity as a result of the lawful or unlawful use of any such ammunition. 
5.5.2 All competitor ammunition and their respective magazines and speed loaders must comply with the provisions of the relevant Division (see Appendix D). 
5.5.3 Spare magazines, speed loaders or ammunition dropped or discarded by a competitor after the Start Signal may be retrieved. However, their retrieval is, at all times, subject to all safety rules. 
5.5.4 Metal piercing, incendiary and/or tracer ammunition is prohibited at IPSC matches (see Rule 10.5.15). 
5.5.5 Ammunition which discharges more than one bullet or other scoring projectile from a single round is prohibited (see Rule 10.5.15). 
5.5.6 Ammunition deemed unsafe by a Range Officer must be immediately withdrawn from the match (see Rule 10.5.15). 
5.6 Power Factors 
5.6.1 There are no minimum or maximum power factors in IPSC Mini Rifle matches. 
5.7 Malfunctions – Competitor’s Equipment 
5.7.1 If a competitor's firearm malfunctions after the Start Signal, the competitor may safely attempt to correct the problem and continue the course of fire. During such corrective action, the competitor must keep the muzzle of the firearm pointing safely downrange at all times. The competitor must not use rods or other tools to verify or correct the malfunction. Violations will result in a zero score for the stage. 
5.7.1.1 A competitor who experiences a firearm malfunction while responding to the "Load And Make Ready" or "Make Ready" command, but prior to issuance of the Start Signal, is entitled to retire, under the authority and supervision of the Range Officer, to repair his firearm, without penalty, subject to the provisions of Rule 5.7.4, Rule 8.3.1.1 and all other safety rules. Once the repairs have been completed (and the provisions of Rule 5.1.7 have been satisfied, if applicable), the competitor may return to attempt the course of fire, subject to scheduling as determined by the Range Officer or Range Master. 
5.7.2 While rectifying a malfunction that requires the competitor to clearly move the firearm away from aiming at a target, the competitor's fingers must be clearly visible outside the trigger guard (see Rule 10.5.8). 
5.7.3 In the event that a firearm malfunction cannot be corrected by the competitor within 2 minutes, or if the competitor self-stops for any other reason, he must point the firearm safely downrange and advise the Range Officer, who will terminate the course of fire in the normal manner. The course of fire will be scored as shot including all applicable misses and penalties. 
5.7.4 Under no circumstances is a competitor permitted to leave a course of fire in the possession of a loaded firearm (see Rule 10.5.13). 
5.7.5 Where the firearm has failed as above, the competitor must not be permitted to reshoot the course of fire. This includes instances where a firearm is declared unserviceable or unsafe during a course of fire (see Rule 5.1.6). 
5.7.6 In the event that a Range Officer terminates a course of fire due to a suspicion that a competitor has an unsafe firearm or unsafe ammunition (e.g. a "squib" load), the Range Officer will take whatever steps he deems necessary to return both the competitor and the range to a safe condition. The Range Officer will then inspect the firearm or ammunition and proceed as follows: 
5.7.6.1 If the Range Officer finds evidence that confirms the suspected problem, the competitor will not be entitled to a reshoot, but will be ordered to rectify the problem. On the competitor's score sheet, the time will be recorded up to the last shot fired, and the course of fire will be scored "as shot", including all applicable misses and penalties (see Rule 9.5.6). 
5.7.6.2 If the Range Officer discovers that the suspected safety problem does not exist, the competitor will be required to reshoot the stage. 
5.7.6.3 A competitor who self-stops due to a suspected or actual squib load is not entitled to a reshoot. 
CHAPTER 6: Match Structure 
6.1 General Principles 
The following definitions are used for clarity: 
6.1.1 Course Of Fire (also "course" and "COF") – A separately timed and scored IPSC shooting challenge, conceptualized and constructed in accordance with IPSC principles of course design, containing targets and challenges which each competitor must safely negotiate. 
6.1.2 Stage – A portion of an IPSC match containing one course of fire and related supporting facilities, amenities, shelter and signage. A stage must use one type of firearm (e.g. rifle) exclusively. 
6.1.3 Match – Consists of a minimum of 3 stages where all stages use the same type of firearm. The total sum of individual stage results will be accumulated to declare a match winner. 
6.1.4 Not applicable. 
6.1.5 Not applicable. 
6.1.6 League – Consists of two or more IPSC matches of a single firearm type held at different locations and on different dates. The total sum of match results attained by each competitor at component matches specified by the league organizers will be accumulated to determine a league winner. 
6.1.7 A Region affiliated to IPSC cannot actively or passively sanction a shooting match of any type or format within the geographical boundaries of another Region without the advance and written approval of the Regional Director of the Region where the match is to be held. A Region in violation is subject to Section 5.9 of the IPSC Constitution. 
6.2 Match Divisions 
6.2.1 IPSC Divisions recognize different firearms and equipment (see Appendix D). Each match must recognize at least one Division. When multiple Divisions are available in a match, each Division must be scored separately and independently, and match results must recognize a winner in each Division. 
6.2.2 In IPSC sanctioned matches, the minimum number of competitors stipulated in Appendix A2 must compete in each Division for it to be recognized. If there are insufficient competitors in a Division, the Match Director may allow that Division to stand without official IPSC recognition. 
6.2.3 Prior to the commencement of a match, each competitor must declare one Division for score, and Match Officials should check competitor equipment compliance with the declared Division, prior to the competitor making an attempt at any of the courses of fire. This is a service to assist competitors verify that their equipment, in the configuration as presented, is in compliance with their declared Division. However, competitors always remain subject to the provisions of Rule 6.2.5.1. 
6.2.3.1 If a competitor disagrees with an equipment compliance ruling, the onus is upon him, prior to him attempting any courses of fire, to provide evidence acceptable to the examiner in support of his claim. In the absence or rejection of such evidence, the original decision will stand, subject only to appeal to the Range Master, whose decision is final. 
6.2.3.2 The competitor’s firearm and all allied equipment accessible to him during a course of fire are subject to compliance testing, if requested by a Match Official. 
6.2.4 Subject to the prior approval of the Match Director, a competitor may enter a match in more than one Division. However, the competitor may compete for score in only one Division, and that must be the first attempt in all cases. Any subsequent attempts in another Division will not be entered into match results nor count for match recognition and awards. 
6.2.5 Where a Division is unavailable or deleted, or where a competitor fails to declare a specific Division prior to the commencement of a match, the competitor will be placed in the Division which, in the opinion of the Range Master, most closely identifies with the competitor's equipment. If, in the opinion of the Range Master, no suitable Division is available, the competitor will shoot the match for no score. 
6.2.5.1 A competitor who fails to satisfy the equipment or other requirements of a declared Division after the Start Signal, will be placed in Open Division, if available, otherwise the competitor’s scores will not be entered into match results. Competitors already registered in Open Division who fail to comply with the requirements of Open Division after the Start Signal will not have their scores entered into match results. 
6.2.5.2 A competitor who is classified or reclassified as above must be notified as soon as possible. The Range Master's decision on these matters is final. 
6.2.5.3 A competitor reclassified to Open Division under Rule 6.2.5.1 will thereafter be subject only to the provisions of Open Division but is required to continue using the same firearm and sights, unless Rule 5.1.7 applies. 
6.2.6 A disqualification incurred by a competitor, at any time during a match, will prevent the competitor from further participation in the match including any subsequent attempts in another Division. However, this is not retroactive. Any previous and complete scores from another Division will be entered into match results for recognition and awards in that Division. 
6.2.7 Recognition of a competitor in a specific Division will not preclude further recognition in a Category or from inclusion as member of a Regional or other team. 
6.3 Match Categories 
6.3.1 IPSC matches may include different Categories within each Division to recognize different groups of competitors. A competitor may declare only one Category for a match. 
6.3.2 Failure to meet the requirements of the declared Category or failure to declare a Category prior to the start of the match will result in exclusion from that Category. Details of currently approved Categories and related requirements are listed in Appendix A2. 
6.4 Regional Teams 
6.4.1 Subject to the availability of allocated slots, only one official Regional team in each Division and/or Division/Category may be selected on merit by each Region for IPSC Level IV or higher matches. Approved Category teams are specified by the IPSC Assembly (see Appendix A2). 
6.4.1.1 At Level IV matches, the only teams permitted are those representing Regions within the zone where the match is being held (e.g. at a European Championship, only teams representing Regions designated by IPSC as belonging to the European Zone can be fielded). 
6.4.1.2 At Level IV and higher matches, official Regional Teams must be "seeded" for squadding purposes in accordance to how the team placed at the same immediately preceding event, if any, even if the team is comprised of different persons. 
6.4.1.3 At Level IV or higher matches, all members of the same official Regional Team must compete together in the same squad in the main match. 
6.4.2 An individual competitor’s scores can only be used exclusively for a single team in a match, and each team must be comprised of competitors in the same Division. 
6.4.2.1 The individual Division and/or Category assigned to a competitor determines his eligibility in respect of teams (e.g. a competitor individually in Standard Division cannot participate in an Open Division team). A female individually registered as "Lady" cannot participate in a team based on age, or vice versa. A competitor individually registered in a Category may be a member of an overall team in the same Division. 
6.4.3 Teams consist of a maximum of 4 members. However, only the final scores of the 3 highest scoring team members will be used to calculate team results. 
6.4.4 If a member of a team retires from the match for any reason before completing all of the stages, scores attained by that competitor will continue to stand towards the team score. However, the affected team is not entitled to replace the retired team member. 
6.4.5 A team member who is unable to commence a match may be replaced prior to commencement by another competitor, subject to the approval of the Match Director. 
6.4.6 If a member of a team is disqualified from a match, the disqualified member’s scores will revert to zero for all stages. Teams will not be entitled to replace a disqualified team member. 
6.5 Competitor Status and Credentials 
6.5.1 All competitors and Match Officials must be individual members of the IPSC Region in which they normally reside. Residency is defined as the Region where the individual is ordinarily domiciled for a minimum of 183 days of the twelve months immediately preceding the month in which the match begins. Ordinarily domiciled condition is a physical presence test and does not relate to citizenship or to any address of convenience. The 183 days need not be consecutive or the most recent 183 days of the twelve month period. 
6.5.1.1 In any case, match organizers must not accept any competitor or Match Official from another Region unless the Regional Director of that Region has confirmed the competitor's or Match Official's eligibility to participate in the subject match, and that the competitor or Match Official is not under sanction from the IPSC Executive Council. 
6.5.1.2 Competitors who ordinarily reside in a country or geographical area which is not affiliated to IPSC may join an IPSC affiliated Region and may compete under the auspices of that Region, subject to the approval of the IPSC Executive Council and the Regional Director of that Region. If a competitor's country or geographical area of residence subsequently applies for affiliation to IPSC, the competitor must become a member of that Region during the affiliation process. 
6.5.2 A competitor and/or team member may represent only the IPSC Region in which they reside, except as follows: 
6.5.2.1 In respect of a competitor who resides in one Region, but who wishes to represent the Region of which they are a citizen, the Regional Directors for the Region of residence and the Region of citizenship must agree in writing prior to the commencement of the match. 
6.5.2.2 A competitor who falls under the conditions of Rule 6.5.1.2 may represent the Region of which they are a member, subject to the prior written approval of the Regional Director. 
6.5.3 At Regional and Continental Championships, only competitors who satisfy the residency requirements stated in Rule 6.5.1 are entitled to be recognized as the Regional or Continental Champion, by Division and/or by Division/Category, as the case may be. However, when determining Regional or Continental Champions, match results of competitors from outside the applicable Region or Continent must not be deleted from the match results, which must remain wholly intact. For example: 
Region 1 Open Division Championships 
100% Competitor A -Region 2 (declared as Overall Match and Division Champion) 99% Competitor B -Region 6 95% Competitor C -Region 1 (declared as Region 1 Champion) 
6.6 Competitor Scheduling and Squadding 
6.6.1 Competitors must compete for score according to the published match and squadding schedule. A competitor who is not present at the scheduled time and date for any stage may not attempt that stage without the prior approval of the Match Director, failing which the competitor's score for that stage will be zero. 
6.6.2 Only Match Officials (approved by the Range Master), match sponsors, IPSC Patrons and dignitaries (approved by the Match Director), who are members in good standing of their Region of residence, and IPSC Officers (as defined in Section 6.1 of the IPSC Constitution) may compete in a pre-match. Scores attained in the pre-match will be included in the overall match results provided dates of the pre-match are published in advance in the official match schedule. Competitors in the main match must not be restricted from viewing the pre-match. 
6.6.3 A match or league will be deemed to have started on the first day that competitors (including those specified above) shoot for score and will be deemed to have ended when the results have been declared final by the Match Director. 
6.7 International Classification System ("ICS") 
6.7.1 The IPSC Executive Council may coordinate and publish dedicated regulations and procedures in order to manage and administer an International Classification System. 
6.7.2 Competitors seeking an international classification must use the approved courses of fire available from the IPSC website. 
CHAPTER 7: Match Management 
7.1 Match Officials 
The duties and terms of reference of Match Officials are defined as follows: 
7.1.1 Range Officer ("RO") – Issues range commands, oversees competitor compliance with the written stage briefing and closely monitors safe competitor action. He also declares the time, scores and penalties achieved by each competitor and verifies that these are correctly recorded on the competitor's score sheet (under the authority of a Chief Range Officer and Range Master). 
7.1.2 Chief Range Officer ("CRO") – Is the primary authority over all persons and activities in the courses of fire under his control, and oversees the fair, correct and consistent application of these rules (under the direct authority of the Range Master). 
7.1.3 Stats Officer ("SO") – Supervises the stats room team, which collects, sorts, verifies, tabulates and retains all score sheets and ultimately produces provisional and final results (under the direct authority of the Range Master). 
7.1.4 Quartermaster ("QM") – Distributes, repairs and maintains all range equipment (e.g. targets, patches, paint, props etc.), other range needs (e.g. timers, batteries, staplers, staples, clipboards etc.) and replenishes Range Officer refreshments (under the direct authority of the Range Master). 
7.1.5 Range Master ("RM") – Has overall authority over all persons and activities within the entire range, including range safety, the operation of all courses of fire and the application of these rules. All disqualifications and appeals to arbitration must be brought to his attention. The Range Master is usually appointed by and works with the Match Director. However, in respect of IPSC sanctioned Level IV or higher matches, the appointment of the Range Master is subject to the prior written approval of the IPSC Executive Council. 
7.1.5.1 References to "Range Master" throughout this rulebook mean the person serving as Range Master at a match (or his authorized delegate for one or more specific functions), regardless of any international or regional rank. 
7.1.6 Match Director ("MD") – Handles overall match administration including squadding, scheduling, range construction, the coordination of all support staff and the provision of services. His authority and decisions will prevail with regard to all matters except in respect of matters in these rules which are the domain of the Range Master. The Match Director is appointed by the host organization and works with the Range Master. 
7.2 Discipline of Match Officials 
7.2.1 The Range Master has authority over all Match Officials other than the Match Director (except when the Match Director is actually participating as a competitor at the match), and is responsible for decisions in matters concerning conduct and discipline. 
7.2.2 In the event that a Match Official is disciplined, the Range Master must send a report of the incident and details of the disciplinary action to the Match Official's Regional Director, the Regional Director of the Region hosting the match, and to the President of the International Range Officers Association (IROA). 
7.2.3 A Match Official who is disqualified from a match for a safety infraction while competing will continue to be eligible to serve as a Match Official for the match. The Range Master will make any decision related to an official's participation. 
7.3 Appointment of Officials 
7.3.1 Match organizers must, prior to commencement of a match, appoint a Match Director and a Range Master to carry out the duties detailed in these rules. The nominated Range Master should preferably be the most competent and experienced certified Match Official present (also see Rule 7.1.5). For Level I and II matches a single person may be appointed to be both the Match Director and the Range Master. 
7.3.2 References in these rules to Match Officials (e.g. "Range Officer", "Range Master" etc.), mean personnel who have been officially appointed by match organizers to actually serve in an official capacity at the match. Persons who are certified Match Officials, but who are actually participating in the match as regular competitors, have no standing or authority as Match Officials for that match. Such persons should therefore not participate in the match wearing garments bearing Match Official insignia. 
7.3.3 A person acting as a Match Official is prohibited from having a holstered firearm while directly accompanying and timing a competitor during his attempt at a COF. Violations are subject to Rule 7.2.2. 
CHAPTER 8: The Course of Fire 
8.1 Rifle Ready Conditions 
The ready condition for rifles will normally be as stated below. However, in the event that a competitor fails to load the chamber when permitted by the written stage briefing, whether inadvertently or intentionally, the Range Officer must not take any action, as the competitor is always responsible for the handling of the rifle. 
8.1.1 Rifles: 
8.1.1.1 Loaded (Option 1): magazine filled and fitted (if applicable), chamber loaded, hammer and/or sear cocked and safety catch applied (if the rifle is designed to have one). 
8.1.1.2 Loaded (Option 2): magazine filled and fitted (if applicable), chamber empty and the action closed. 
8.1.1.3 Unloaded (Option 3): fixed magazine must be empty, detachable magazines removed and chamber must be empty. The action may be open or closed. 
8.1.2 Not applicable. 
8.1.3 Courses of fire may require ready conditions which are different to those stated above. In such cases, the required ready condition must be clearly stated in the written stage briefing. 
8.1.3.1 When a written stage briefing requires that a competitor’s firearm and/or allied equipment be placed on a table or another surface prior to the Start Signal, they must be placed as stipulated in the written stage briefing. Apart from components normally affixed to them (e.g. a thumb rest, thumb safety, racking or cocking handle, base pad etc.), other items must not be used to artificially elevate them (also see Rule 5.1.8). 
8.1.4 Unless complying with a Division requirement (see Appendix D), a competitor must not be restricted on the number of rounds to be loaded or reloaded in a rifle. Written stage briefings may only stipulate when the firearm is to be loaded or when mandatory reloads are required, when permitted under Rule 1.1.5.2. 
8.2 Competitor Ready Condition 
This designates when, under the direct command of a Range Officer: 
8.2.1 The rifle is prepared, made safe and held or placed as specified in the written stage briefing. 
8.2.2 Unless specified in the written stage briefing, the competitor’s stance prior to the commencement of the course of fire must be standing erect, with the rifle in the ready condition, held in both hands, stock touching the competitor at hip level, barrel parallel to the ground, trigger guard downwards, muzzle pointing downrange and with the fingers outside the trigger guard. This applies to all rifle ready conditions, unless otherwise specified in the written stage briefing. 
8.2.2.1 Unless otherwise stated in the written stage briefing holding the gun upside down is not acceptable. 
8.2.2.2 A competitor who attempts or completes a course of fire where an incorrect start position was used may be required by a Range Officer to reshoot the course of fire. 
8.2.2.3 Different stages may require the "ready position" to be prone, kneeling, sitting or as otherwise stated in the written stage briefing. However, the "ready condition" of the rifle stipulated here and the general outline of the "ready position" will prevail. 
8.2.2.4 A course of fire must never permit a competitor to start a stage with the rifle mounted into the shoulder and pointing towards targets. 
8.2.3 A course of fire must never require or allow a competitor to touch or hold a magazine, loading device or ammunition, other than a magazine fitted to the rifle, after the "Standby" command and before the Start Signal (except for unavoidable touching with the lower arms). 
8.3 Range Communication 
The approved range commands and their sequence are as follows: 
8.3.1 "Load And Make Ready" (or "Make Ready" for starts with an unloaded firearm) – This command signifies the start of "the Course of Fire". Under the direct supervision of the Range Officer the competitor must face downrange, or in a safe direction as specified by the Range Officer, fit eye and ear protection, and prepare the firearm in accordance with the written stage briefing. The competitor must then assume the required start position. At this point, the Range Officer will proceed. 
8.3.1.1 Once the appropriate command has been given, the competitor must not move away from the start location prior to issuance of the Start Signal without the prior approval, and under the direct supervision, of the Range Officer. Violation will result in a warning for the first offense and may result in the application of Rule 10.6.1 for a subsequent offense in the same match. 
8.3.2 "Are You Ready?" – The lack of any negative response from the competitor indicates that he fully understands the requirements of the course of fire and is ready to proceed. If the competitor is not ready at this command, he must state "Not Ready". When the competitor is ready he should assume the required start position to indicate his readiness to the Range Officer. 
8.3.3 "Standby" – This command should be followed by the Start Signal within 1 to 4 seconds (also see Rule 10.2.6). 
8.3.4 "Start Signal" – The signal for the competitor to begin their attempt at the course of fire. If a competitor fails to react to a Start Signal, for any reason, the Range Officer will confirm that the competitor is ready to attempt the course of fire, and will resume the range commands from "Are You Ready?" 
8.3.4.1 In the event that a competitor inadvertently begins shooting prematurely ("false start"), the Range Officer will, as soon as possible, stop and restart the competitor once the course of fire has been restored. 
8.3.4.2 A competitor who reacts to a Start Signal but, for any reason, does not continue their attempt at the course of fire and fails to have an official time recorded on the timing device operated by the Range Officer, will be given a zero time and zero score for that stage. 
8.3.5 "Stop" – Any Range Officer assigned to a stage may issue this command at any time during the course of fire. The competitor must immediately cease firing, stop moving and wait for further instructions from the Range Officer. 
8.3.5.1 When two or more courses of fire share a common shooting bay or area, Range Officers may issue other interim commands on completion of the first COF, in order to prepare the competitor for the second and subsequent COF (e.g. "Reload if required"). Any such interim commands to be used must be clearly stated in the written stage briefing. 
8.3.6 "If You Are Finished, Unload And Show Clear" – If the competitor has finished shooting, he must lower his rifle and present it for inspection by the Range Officer with the muzzle pointed downrange, fixed magazine empty or detachable magazine removed and chamber empty, action held or latched open. 
8.3.7 "If Clear, Secure Chamber" – After issuance of this command, the competitor must not resume shooting (see Rule 10.6.1). While continuing to point the rifle safely downrange, a chamber safety flag must be fitted, at which time the course of fire is deemed to have ended. The action can remain open or be closed, but the competitor must then comply with Rule 5.2.1. 
8.3.8 "Range Is Clear" – Competitors or Match Personnel must not move forward of, or away from, the firing line or final shooting location until this declaration is given by the Range Officer. Once the declaration is made, officials and competitors may move forward to score, patch, reset targets etc. 
8.3.9 A competitor with a severe hearing disability may, subject to prior approval of the Range Master, be entitled to have the foregoing verbal Range Communications supplemented by visual and/or physical signals. 
8.3.9.1 The recommended physical signals are taps on the competitor’s weak side shoulder using a countdown protocol, namely 3 taps for "Are You Ready?", 2 taps for "Standby" and 1 tap to coincide with the Start Signal. 
8.3.9.2 Competitors wishing instead to use their own electronic or other device must firstly submit it for 
examination, testing and approval by the Range Master before it can be used. 
8.3.10 There are no fixed range communications designated for use at an equipment compliance check (which may be conducted at a venue away from the shooting range). Competitors must not remove chamber safety flags from long guns until the examiner asks for them to be passed to him, in accordance with his instructions. Violations are subject to Rule 10.5.1. 
8.4 Loading, Reloading or Unloading During a Course of Fire 
8.4.1 When loading, reloading or unloading during a course of fire, the competitor's fingers must be visibly outside the trigger guard, except where specifically permitted (see Rule 10.5.9), and the firearm must be pointed safely downrange or in another safe direction authorized by a Range Officer (see Rules 10.5.1 and 10.5.2). 
8.5 Movement 
8.5.1 Except when the competitor is actually aiming or shooting at targets, all movement must be accomplished with the fingers visibly outside the trigger guard and the external safety should be applied. The firearm must be pointed in a safe direction. "Movement" is defined as any of the actions below: 
8.5.1.1 Taking more than one step in any direction. 
8.5.1.2 Changing shooting position (e.g. from standing to kneeling, from seated to standing etc.). 
8.6 Assistance or Interference 
8.6.1 No assistance of any kind can be given to a competitor during a course of fire, except that any Range Officer assigned to a stage may issue safety warnings to a competitor at any time. Such warnings will not be grounds for the competitor to be awarded a reshoot. 
8.6.1.1 Competitors confined to wheelchairs or similar devices may be given special dispensation by the Range Master in respect of mobility assistance. However, the provisions of Rule 10.2.10 may still apply, at the Range Master’s discretion. 
8.6.2 Any person providing assistance to a competitor during a course of fire without the prior approval of a Range Officer (and the competitor receiving such assistance) may, at the discretion of a Range Officer, incur a procedural penalty for that stage and/or be subject to Section 10.6. 
8.6.3 Any person verbally or otherwise interfering with a competitor during his attempt at a course of fire may be subject to Section 10.6. If the Range Officer believes that the interference significantly affected the competitor, he must report the incident to the Range Master, who may, at his discretion, offer the affected competitor a reshoot. 
8.6.4 In the event that inadvertent contact with the Range Officer or another external influence has interfered with the competitor during a course of fire, the Range Officer may offer the competitor a reshoot of the course of fire. The competitor must accept or decline the offer prior to seeing either the time or the score from the initial attempt. However, if the competitor commits a safety infraction during any such interference, the provisions of Sections 10.4 and 10.5 may still apply. 
8.6.5 In the event that any person appears downrange from the competitor during a course of fire, it must immediately be terminated and the competitor required to reshoot the course of fire. If the competitor notices the problem before the Range Officer, he must immediately self-stop, cease firing, point his firearm in a safe direction and wait for further instructions from the Range Officer. However, if the competitor fails to comply with the above procedure, the provisions of Sections 10.4 and 10.5 will apply. 
8.6.6 Drones or other remotely controlled devices are prohibited unless their use is approved in advance by the Match Director. 
8.7 Sight Pictures, Dry Firing and Course Inspection 
8.7.1 Competitors are prohibited from taking a sight picture with a loaded firearm prior to the Start Signal. Violation will result in a warning for the first occurrence and one procedural penalty for each subsequent occurrence in the same match. 
8.7.1.1 If match organizers also prohibit taking a sight picture with an unloaded firearm prior to the Start Signal, competitors must be advised in the written stage briefing. Violation will result in a warning for the first occurrence and one procedural penalty for each subsequent occurrence in the same match. 
8.7.1.2 When permitted, competitors taking a sight picture with an unloaded firearm prior to the Start Signal must only do so on a single target, to verify that their sights are prepared as required. Competitors who test a targeting sequence or a shooting position while taking a sight picture will incur one procedural penalty per occurrence. 
8.7.2 Competitors are prohibited from using any sighting aid (e.g. the whole or part of an imitation or replica firearm, any part of a real firearm including any accessories thereof etc.), except for their own hands, while conducting their inspection ("walkthrough") of a course of fire. Violations will incur one procedural penalty per occurrence (also see Rule 10.5.1). 
8.7.3 No person is permitted to enter or move through a course of fire without the prior approval of a Range Officer assigned to that course of fire, or the Range Master. Violations will incur a warning for the first offense but may be subject to the provisions of Section 10.6 for subsequent offenses. 
CHAPTER 9: Scoring 
9.1 General Regulations 
9.1.1 Approaching Targets – While scoring is in progress, competitors or their delegate must not approach any target closer than 1 meter without the authorization of the Range Officer. Violation will result in a warning for the first offense, but the competitor or his delegate may, at the discretion of the Range Officer, incur a procedural penalty for subsequent occurrences in the same match. 
9.1.2 Touching Targets – While scoring is in progress competitors or their delegate must not touch, gauge or otherwise interfere with any target without the authorization of the Range Officer. Should a Range Officer deem that a competitor or their delegate has influenced or affected the scoring process due to such interference, the Range Officer may: 
9.1.2.1 Score the affected target as a missed target; or 
9.1.2.2 Impose penalties for any affected no-shoots. 
9.1.3 Prematurely Patched Targets – If a target is prematurely patched or taped, preventing the determination of the actual score, the Range Officer must order the competitor to reshoot the course of fire. 
9.1.4 Unrestored Targets – If, following completion of a course of fire by a previous competitor, one or more targets have not been properly patched or taped for the competitor being scored, the Range Officer must judge whether or not an accurate score can be determined. If there are extra scoring hits or questionable penalty hits thereon, and it is not obvious which hits were made by the competitor being scored, the affected competitor must be ordered to reshoot the course of fire. 
9.1.4.1 In the event that patches or tape applied to a restored paper target are accidentally blown off by wind, muzzle blast or another reason, and it is not obvious to the Range Officer which hits were made by the competitor being scored, the competitor will be required to reshoot the course of fire. 
9.1.4.2 A competitor who hesitates or self-stops during his attempt at a course of fire, due to a belief that one or more targets have not been restored or reset, is not entitled to a reshoot. 
9.1.5 Impenetrable – The scoring area of all IPSC scoring targets and no-shoots is deemed to be impenetrable. If a: 
9.1.5.1 Bullet strikes wholly within the scoring area of a paper target, and continues on to strike the scoring area of another paper target, the hit on the subsequent paper target will not count for score or penalty, as the case may be. 
9.1.5.2 Bullet strikes wholly within the scoring area of a paper target, and continues on to hit or strike down a metal target, or hits a frangible target or an electronically registering target that activates other range equipment, this will be treated as range equipment failure. The competitor will be required to reshoot the course of fire, after it has been restored. 
9.1.5.3 Bullet strikes partially within the scoring area of a paper or metal target, and continues on to strike the scoring area of another paper target, the hit on the subsequent paper target will also count for score or penalty, as the case may be. 
9.1.5.4 Bullet strikes partially within the scoring area of a paper or metal target, and continues on to strike down (or hit the scoring area of) another metal target, the fallen (or hit on the) subsequent metal target will also count for score or penalty, as the case may be. 
9.1.6 Hard Cover – Unless specifically described as "soft cover" (see Rule 4.1.4.2) in the written stage briefing, all props, walls, barriers, vision screens and other obstacles are deemed to be impenetrable "hard cover". If a: 
9.1.6.1 Bullet strikes wholly within hard cover, and continues on to strike the scoring area of a scoring paper target or no-shoot, the hit on the paper target will not count for score or penalty, as the case may be. 
9.1.6.2 Bullet strikes wholly within hard cover, and continues on to hit or strike down a metal target, or hits a frangible target or an electronically registering target that activates other range equipment, this will be treated as range equipment failure (see Rule 4.6.1). The competitor will be required to reshoot the course of fire, after it has been restored. 
9.1.6.3 Bullet strikes partially within hard cover, and continues on to strike the scoring area of a paper target, the hit on that paper target will count for score or penalty, as the case may be. 
9.1.6.4 Bullet strikes partially within hard cover, and continues on to strike down a scoring metal target, the fallen target will count for score. If a bullet strikes partially within hard cover, and continues on to strike down or hit a metal no-shoot, the fallen no-shoot or hit thereon will count for penalty. 
9.1.7 Target Sticks – Are neither Hard Cover nor Soft Cover. Shots which have passed wholly or partially through target sticks and which hit a paper or metal target will count for score or penalty, as the case may be. 
9.2 Scoring Method 
9.2.1 "Comstock" – Unlimited time stops on the last shot, unlimited number of shots to be fired, stipulated number of hits per target to count for score. 
9.2.1.1 A competitor's score is calculated by adding the highest value stipulated number of hits per target, minus penalties, divided by the total time (recorded to two decimal places) taken by the competitor to complete the course of fire, to arrive at a hit factor. The overall stage results are factored by awarding the competitor with the highest hit factor the maximum points available for the course of fire, with all other competitors ranked relatively below the stage winner. 
9.2.2 Stage results must rank competitors within the relevant Division in descending order of individual stage points achieved, calculated to 4 decimal places. 
9.2.3 Match results must rank competitors within the relevant Division in descending order of the combined total of individual stage points achieved, calculated to 4 decimal places. 
9.3 Scoring Ties 
9.3.1 If, in the opinion of the Match Director, a tie in match results must be broken, the affected competitors must shoot one or more courses of fire, nominated or created by the Match Director, until the tie is broken. The result of a tiebreaker will only be used to determine the final placing of the affected competitors, and their original match points will remain unchanged. Ties must never be broken by chance. 
9.4 Target Scoring and Penalty Values 
9.4.1 Scoring hits on IPSC targets will be scored in accordance with the values approved by the IPSC Assembly (see Appendices B and C and below). Frangible targets will usually score 5 points. 
9.4.1.1 It is recommended that disappearing metal and frangible targets be scored 10 points per target. 
9.4.1.2 Metal and frangible targets that require a difficult shot may score 10 points per target. 
9.4.1.3 Not applicable. 
9.4.1.4 The scoring of targets as referred to in Rules 9.4.1.1 and 9.4.1.2 is restricted to not more than 10% of the total number of targets in the match. Their use must have been approved during the course review process and they must be clearly identified in the written stage briefing. 
9.4.2 Each hit visible on the scoring area of a paper no-shoot will be penalized minus 10 points, up to a maximum of 2 hits per no-shoot. 
9.4.3 Metal no-shoots must be shot and fall, overturn or self-indicate to score and then will be penalized minus 10 points. 
9.4.4 Each miss will be penalized minus 10 points, except in the case of disappearing targets (see Rule 9.9.2). 
9.5 Target Scoring Policy 
9.5.1 Unless otherwise specified in the written stage briefing, scoring paper targets must be shot with a minimum of one round each, with the best two hits to score. Scoring metal targets must be shot with a minimum of one round each and must fall or otherwise react to score. 
9.5.2 If the bullet diameter of a hit on a scoring target touches the scoring line between two scoring areas, or the line between the non-scoring border and a scoring area, or if it crosses multiple scoring areas, it will be scored the higher value. 
9.5.3 If a bullet diameter touches the scoring area of overlapping scoring targets and/or no-shoots, it will earn all applicable scores and penalties. 
9.5.4 Radial tears radiating outwards from the diameter of a bullet hole will not count for score or penalty. 
9.5.4.1 Enlarged holes in paper targets which exceed the competitor's bullet diameter will not count for score or penalty unless there is visible evidence within the remnants of the hole (e.g. a grease mark, striations or a "crown" etc.), to eliminate a presumption that the hole was caused by a ricochet or splatter. 
9.5.5 The minimum score for a stage will be zero. 
9.5.6 A competitor who fails to engage the front of each scoring target in a course of fire with at least one round will incur one procedural penalty per target for failure to engage at the target, as well as appropriate penalties for misses (see Rule 10.2.7). 
9.5.7 Hits visible on a scoring paper target or no-shoot, which are the result of shots fired through the rear of that or another scoring paper target or no-shoot, and/or hits which fail to create a clearly distinguishable hole through the front of a scoring paper target or no-shoot, will not count for score or penalty, as the case may be. 
9.5.8 Frangible targets must be fully penetrated or break with a piece separated from the original target to be counted for score. 
9.6 Score Verification and Challenge 
9.6.1 After the Range Officer has declared "Range is Clear", the competitor or their delegate will be permitted to accompany the official responsible for scoring to verify the scoring. However, this may not apply to courses of fire consisting only of reactive targets or self-setting targets and/or electronically registering targets. 
9.6.2 The Range Officer responsible for a course of fire may stipulate that the scoring process will begin while a competitor is actually completing a course of fire. In such cases, the competitor’s delegate is entitled to accompany the official responsible for scoring in order to verify the scoring. Competitors must be advised of this procedure during the squad briefing. 
9.6.3 A competitor (or his delegate) who fails to verify a target during the scoring process loses all right of appeal in respect of scoring that target. 
9.6.4 Any challenge to a score or penalty must be appealed to the Range Officer by the competitor (or his delegate) prior to the subject target being painted, patched, or reset, failing which such challenges will not be accepted. 
9.6.5 In the event that the Range Officer upholds the original score or penalty and the competitor is dissatisfied, he may appeal to the Chief Range Officer and then to the Range Master for a ruling. 
9.6.6 The Range Master’s ruling in respect of the scoring of hits on targets and no-shoots will be final. No further appeals are permitted with respect to such scoring decisions. 
9.6.7 During a scoring challenge, the subject target(s) must not be patched, taped or otherwise interfered with until the matter has been settled, failing which Rule 9.1.3 will apply. The Range Officer may remove a disputed paper target from the course of fire for further examination to prevent any delay in the match. Both the competitor and the Range Officer must sign the target and clearly indicate which hit(s) is (are) subject to challenge. 
9.6.8 Scoring overlays approved by the Range Master must be used exclusively, as and when required, to verify and/or determine the applicable scoring zone of hits on paper targets. 
9.6.9 Scoring information may be relayed through the use of hand signals (see Appendix F1). If a score is challenged, the subject targets must not be restored until they have been verified by the competitor or his delegate, in accordance with whatever arrangements have been approved in advance by the Range Master (also see Rule 9.1.3). 
9.7 Score Sheets 
9.7.1 The Range Officer must enter all information (including any warnings given) on each competitor’s score sheet prior to signing it. After the Range Officer has signed the score sheet, the competitor must add his own signature in the appropriate place. Electronic score sheet signatures will be acceptable if approved by the Regional Director. Whole numbers should be used to record all scores or penalties. The elapsed time taken by the competitor to complete the course of fire must be recorded to 2 decimal places in the appropriate place. 
9.7.2 If corrections to the score sheet are required, these will be clearly entered onto the original and other copies of the competitor’s score sheets. The competitor and the Range Officer should initial any corrections. 
9.7.3 Should a competitor refuse to sign or initial a score sheet, for any reason, the matter must be referred to the Range Master. If the Range Master is satisfied that the course of fire has been conducted and scored correctly the unsigned score sheet will be submitted as normal for inclusion in the match results. 
9.7.4 A score sheet signed by both a competitor and a Range Officer is conclusive evidence that the course of fire has been completed, and that the time, scores and penalties recorded on the score sheet, are accurate and uncontested. The signed score sheet is deemed to be a definitive document and, with the exception of the mutual consent of the competitor and the signatory Range Officer, or due to an arbitration decision, the score sheet will only be changed to correct arithmetical errors or to add procedural penalties under Rule 8.6.2. 
9.7.5 If a score sheet is found to have insufficient or excess entries, or if the time has not been recorded on the score sheet, it must be promptly referred to the Range Master who will normally require the competitor to reshoot the course of fire. 
9.7.6 In the event that a reshoot is not possible for any reason, the following actions will prevail: 
9.7.6.1 If the time is missing, the competitor will receive a zero score for the stage. 
9.7.6.2 If insufficient hits or misses have been recorded on the score sheet, those which have been recorded will be deemed complete and conclusive. 
9.7.6.3 If excessive hits or misses have been recorded on the score sheet, the highest value scoring hits recorded will be used. 
9.7.6.4 Procedural penalties recorded on the score sheet will be deemed complete and conclusive, except where Rule 8.6.2 applies. 
9.7.6.5 If the identity of the competitor is missing from a score sheet, it must be referred to the Range Master, who must take whatever action he deems necessary to rectify the situation. 
9.7.7 In the event that an original score sheet is lost or otherwise unavailable, the competitor's duplicate copy, or any other written or electronic record acceptable to the Range Master, will be used. If the competitor's copy, or any other written or electronic record, is unavailable, or is deemed by the Range Master to be insufficiently legible the competitor will be required to reshoot the course of fire. If the Range Master deems that a reshoot is not possible for any reason, the competitor will incur a zero time and score for the affected stage. 
9.7.7.1 Once a reshoot has been completed, the outcome of the reshoot will stand, even if a record of the original score is subsequently discovered. 
9.7.8 No person, other than an authorized Match Official, is permitted to handle an original score sheet retained on a stage, or at any other place, after it has been signed by a competitor and a Range Officer, without the prior approval of the Range Officer or personnel directly involved with Stats. Violations will incur a warning for the first offense, but may be subject to Section 10.6 for subsequent occurrences in the same match. 
9.8 Scoring Responsibility 
9.8.1 Each competitor has a responsibility to maintain an accurate record of their scores by verifying the lists posted by the Stats Officer. 
9.8.2 After all competitors have completed a match, the provisional stage results must be published and posted in a conspicuous place at the shooting range and, at Level IV or higher matches, at the official match hotel for the purpose of verification by competitors. The time and date the subject results were actually posted (not just printed) at each venue must be clearly stated thereon. 
9.8.3 If a competitor detects an error in those results, he must file an appeal with the Stats Officer within 1 hour after the results were actually posted. If the appeal is not filed within the time limit, the posted scores will stand and the appeal will be dismissed. 
9.8.4 Competitors who are scheduled (or otherwise authorized by the Match Director) to complete all courses of fire in a match in a period of time less than the full duration of the match (e.g. 1 day format in a 3 day match etc.), are required to check their provisional match results in accordance with the special procedures and time limits specified by the Match Director (e.g. via a website), failing which scoring appeals will not be accepted. The relevant procedure must be published in advance in match literature and/or by way of a notice posted in a conspicuous place at the shooting range prior to commencement of the match (also see Section 6.6). 
9.8.5 A Match Director may elect to have results posted electronically (e.g. via a website) either in addition to, or as an alternative to, physically printing them. If so, the relevant procedure must be published in advance in match literature and/or by way of a notice posted in a conspicuous place at the shooting range prior to commencement of the match. Facilities (e.g. a computer) must be provided for competitors to view the results if a Match Director has elected to only have results posted electronically. 
9.9 Scoring of Disappearing Targets 
9.9.1 Moving targets which present at least a portion of the A zone when at rest (either before or after initial activation), or which continuously appear and disappear for the duration of a competitor’s attempt at a COF, are not disappearing and will always incur failure to engage and/or miss penalties. 
9.9.2 Moving targets, which do not comply with the above criteria, are disappearing and will not incur failure to engage or miss penalties unless a competitor fails to activate the mechanism which initiates the target movement before or when firing his last shot for that course of fire. 
9.9.3 Stationary targets which present at least a portion of the A zone, either before or after activation of a moving and/or concealing no-shoot or vision barrier, are not disappearing and will incur failure to engage and/or miss penalties. 
9.9.4 Targets which present at least a portion of the A zone each time a competitor operates a mechanical activator 
(e.g. a rope, lever, pedal, flap, door etc.), are not subject to this section. 
9.9.5 If a COF requires that a competitor be confined to an apparatus which travels from one location to another location during his attempt at a COF, any target which can only be engaged from the apparatus for part of its travel, and which cannot subsequently be reengaged, is deemed to be disappearing. 
9.10 Official Time 
9.10.1 Only the timing device operated by a Range Officer must be used to record the official elapsed time of a competitor's attempt at a course of fire. If a Range Officer assigned to a course of fire (or a more senior Match Official) deems that a timing device is faulty, a competitor whose attempt cannot be credited with an accurate time will be required to reshoot the course of fire. 
9.10.2 If, in the opinion of an Arbitration Committee, the time credited to a competitor for a course of fire is deemed to be unrealistic, the competitor will be required to reshoot the course of fire (see Rule 9.7.4). 
9.11 Scoring Programs 
9.11.1 
The official scoring program for all Level IV or higher matches is the latest version of the Windows® Match Scoring System (WinMSS), unless another scoring program is approved by the IPSC President. For other level matches, no other scoring program can be used without the approval of the Regional Director of the host Region. 


CHAPTER 10: Penalties and Disqualifications 

10.1  Procedural Penalties – General Regulations  
10.1.1  Procedural penalties are imposed when a competitor fails to comply with procedures specified in a written stage briefing and/or is found to be in violation of other general rules. The Range Officer imposing the procedural penalties must clearly record the number of penalties, and the reason why they were imposed, on the competitor's score sheet.  
10.1.2  Procedural penalties are assessed at minus 10 points each.  
10.1.3  A competitor disputing the application or number of procedural penalties may appeal to the Chief Range Officer and/or Range Master. A competitor who continues to be aggrieved may then lodge an appeal for arbitration.  
10.1.4  Procedural penalties cannot be nullified by further competitor action. For example, a competitor who fires a shot at a target while faulting a line will still incur the applicable penalties even though he subsequently shoots at the same target while not faulting the line.  
10.2  Procedural Penalties – Specific Examples  
10.2.1  A competitor who fires shots while any part of their body is touching the ground or any object beyond a Fault Line will receive 1 procedural penalty for each occurrence. No penalty is assessed if a competitor does not fire any shots while faulting except when Rule 2.2.1.5 applies.  
10.2.1.1  However, if the competitor has gained a significant advantage on any target(s) while faulting, he may instead be assessed 1 procedural penalty for each shot fired at the subject target(s) while faulting.  
10.2.2  A competitor who fails to comply with a procedure specified in the written stage briefing will incur 1 procedural penalty for each occurrence. However, if a competitor has gained a significant advantage during non-compliance, the competitor may be assessed 1 procedural penalty for each shot fired, instead of a single penalty (e.g. firing one or more shots contrary to the required location, shooting position or stance).  
10.2.3  Where multiple penalties are assessed in the above cases, they must not exceed the maximum number of scoring hits that can be attained by the competitor. For example, a competitor who gains an advantage while faulting a Fault Line where only 4 metal targets are visible will receive 1 procedural penalty for each shot fired while faulting, up to a maximum of 4 procedural penalties, regardless of the number of shots actually fired.  
10.2.4  A competitor who fails to comply with a mandatory reload will incur 1 procedural penalty for each shot fired after the point where the reload was required until a reload is performed.  
10.2.5  In a Cooper Tunnel, a competitor who disturbs one or more pieces of the overhead material will receive 1 procedural penalty for each piece of overhead material which falls. Overhead material which falls as a result of the competitor bumping or striking the uprights, or as a result of muzzle gases or recoil, will not be penalized.  
10.2.6  A competitor who is creeping (e.g. moving hands towards the firearm, a reloading device or ammunition) or physically moving to a more advantageous shooting position or stance after the "Standby" command and prior to issuance of the Start Signal, will incur 1 procedural penalty. If the Range Officer can stop the competitor in time, a warning will be issued for the first offense and the competitor will be restarted.  
10.2.7  A competitor who fails to engage any scoring target with at least one round will incur 1 procedural penalty per target, plus the applicable number of misses, except where the provisions of Rule 9.9.2 apply.  
10.2.8  Not applicable.  
10.2.9  A competitor who leaves a shooting location may return and shoot again from the same location provided they do so safely. However, written stage briefings for Classifiers and Level I & II matches may prohibit such actions, in which case 1 procedural penalty per shot fired will apply.  
10.2.10 Special penalty: A competitor unable to fully execute any part of a course of fire due to incapacity or injury may, prior to making his attempt at the course of fire, request that the Range Master apply a penalty in lieu of the stated course requirement.
10.2.10.1 If the request is approved by the Range Master, he must state, in advance of the competitor attempting the course of fire, the extent of the special penalty, ranging from 1% to 20% of the competitor's points "as shot", to be deducted. 
10.2.10.2 Alternatively, the Range Master may waive application of any penalties in respect of a competitor who, due to having a significant physical disability, is unable to comply with the stated course requirement. 
10.2.10.3 If the request is denied by the Range Master, normal procedural penalties will apply. 
10.2.11 A competitor who fires shots over a barrier constructed to a height of at least 1.8 meters will incur 1 procedural penalty for each shot fired (also see Rule 2.2.3.1). 
10.2.12 Should a competitor engage a target or targets with burst or fully automatic fire (where more than one shot is discharged with one manipulation of the trigger) due to the firearm being in the automatic mode, he will be scored zero for that stage and a warning issued. In the event of a second violation of this rule he will be disqualified. In the event that the discharge was in an unsafe direction or as defined in 10.3.1, the regulations for that Section will apply. 
10.3 Disqualification – General Regulations 
10.3.1 A competitor who commits a safety infraction or any other prohibited activity during an IPSC match will be disqualified, and will be prohibited from attempting any remaining courses of fire regardless of the schedule or physical layout of the match, pending the verdict of any appeal submitted in accordance with Chapter 11 of these rules. 
10.3.2 When a disqualification is issued, the Range Officer must record the reasons for the disqualification, and the time and date of the incident, on the competitor's score sheet, and the Range Master must be notified as soon as possible. 
10.3.3 Scores for a competitor who has received a disqualification must not be deleted from match results, and match results must not be declared final by the Match Director, until the time limit prescribed in Rule 11.3.1 has passed, provided no appeal to arbitration on any matter has been submitted to the Range Master (or his delegate). 
10.3.4 If an appeal to arbitration is submitted within the time limit prescribed in Rule 11.3.1, the provisions of Rule 11.3.2 will prevail. 
10.3.5 Scores for a competitor who has completed a pre-match or main match without a disqualification will not be affected by a disqualification received while that competitor is participating in a Shoot-Off or other side match (also see Rule 6.2.4). 
10.4 Disqualification – Accidental Discharge 
A competitor who causes an accidental discharge must be stopped by a Range Officer as soon as possible. An accidental discharge is defined as follows: 
10.4.1 A shot, which travels over a backstop, a berm or in any other direction, specified in the written stage briefing by the match organizers as being unsafe. Note that a competitor who legitimately fires a shot at a target, which then travels in an unsafe direction, will not be disqualified, but the provisions of Section 2.3 may apply. 
10.4.2 A shot which strikes the ground within 3 meters of the competitor, except when shooting at a paper or frangible target closer than 3 meters to the competitor. A shot which strikes the ground within 3 meters of the competitor due to a "squib" load is exempt from this rule. 
10.4.3 A shot which occurs while actually loading, reloading or unloading a firearm. This includes any shot fired during the procedures outlined in Rules 8.3.1 and 8.3.7 (also see Rule 10.5.9). 
10.4.3.1 Exception – a detonation, which occurs while unloading a firearm, is not considered a shot or discharge subject to a disqualification. However, Rule 5.1.6 may apply. 
10.4.4 A shot which occurs during remedial action in the case of a malfunction. 
10.4.5 A shot which occurs while transferring a rifle between hands. 
10.4.6 A shot which occurs during movement, except while actually shooting at targets. 
10.4.7 A shot fired at a metal target from a distance of less than 5 meters, measured from the front of the target to the nearest part of the competitor's body in contact with the ground (see Rule 2.1.3). 
10.4.8 In this Section, if it can be established that the cause of the discharge is due to a broken or defective part of the firearm, the competitor has not committed any safety infraction in this Section, and a disqualification will not be invoked, but the competitor's scores for that stage will be zero. 
10.4.8.1 The firearm must be immediately presented for inspection to the Range Master or his delegate, who will inspect the firearm and carry out any tests necessary to establish that a broken or defective part caused the discharge. A competitor may not later appeal a disqualification for an accidental discharge due to a broken or defective part if they fail to present the firearm for inspection prior to leaving the course of fire. 
10.5 Disqualification – Unsafe Gun Handling 
Examples of unsafe gun handling include, but are not limited to: 
10.5.1 Handling a rifle at any time except when in a designated Safety Area, or elsewhere deemed safe by a Range Officer, or when under the supervision of, and in response to a direct command issued by, a Range Officer may invoke a disqualification. This does not apply to the carrying of rifles where Rule 5.2.1 will apply. Violation of Rule 5.2.1 may invoke a disqualification. 
10.5.2 Allowing the muzzle of a firearm to point uprange, or past the default, or specific safe angles of fire during a course of fire. Exception: when fitting the chamber safety flag in compliance with Rule 8.3.7 the muzzle may point uprange within a radius of 50 cm from a competitor’s feet. 
10.5.3 If at any time during the course of fire, a competitor drops his firearm or causes it to fall, loaded or not. Note that a competitor who, for any reason during a course of fire, safely and intentionally places the firearm on the ground or other stable object will not be disqualified provided: 
10.5.3.1 The competitor maintains constant physical contact with the firearm, until it is placed firmly and securely on the ground or another stable object; and 
10.5.3.2 The competitor remains within 1 meter of the firearm at all times (except where the firearm is placed at a greater distance, under the supervision of a Range Officer, in order to comply with a start position); and 
10.5.3.3 The provisions of Rule 10.5.2 do not occur; and 
10.5.3.4 The firearm is in the ready condition as specified in Section 8.1; or 
10.5.3.5 The firearm is unloaded and the action is open. 
10.5.4 Not applicable. 
10.5.5 Allowing the muzzle of a rifle to point at any part of the competitor's body during a course of fire (i.e. sweeping). 
10.5.6 Not applicable. 
10.5.7 Using more than one firearm during a course of fire. 
10.5.8 Failure to keep the finger outside the trigger guard while clearing a malfunction where the competitor clearly moves the firearm away from aiming at targets. 
10.5.9  Failure to keep the finger outside the trigger guard during loading, reloading, or unloading. A competitor will be exempt from this rule when operating the trigger to dry fire or to release the action and/or drop the hammer while making ready prior to the Start Signal. In the event that the gun discharges during this operation Rule 10.4.3 will still apply.  
10.5.10  Failure to keep the finger outside the trigger guard during movement in accordance with Rule 8.5.1.  
10.5.11  Not applicable.  
10.5.12  Handling live or dummy ammunition in a Safety Area, contrary to Rule 2.4.4.  
10.5.12.1 The word "handling" does not preclude competitors from entering a Safety Area with live or dummy ammunition in their pockets, on their belt or in their range bag, provided the competitor does not physically remove the loose or packaged ammunition from their belt, pockets or range bag while within the Safety Area.  
10.5.13  Having a loaded firearm other than when specifically authorized by a Range Officer.  
10.5.14  Retrieving a dropped firearm. Dropped firearms must always be retrieved by a Range Officer who will, after checking and/or clearing the firearm, return it to the competitor in a safe condition. Dropping an unloaded firearm or causing it to fall outside of a course of fire is not an infraction. However, a competitor who retrieves a dropped firearm will receive a disqualification.  
10.5.15  Using prohibited and/or unsafe ammunition (see Rules 5.5.4, 5.5.5 and 5.5.6), and/or using a prohibited firearm (see Rules 5.1.10 and 5.1.11).  
10.6  Disqualification – Unsportsmanlike Conduct  
10.6.1  Competitors will be disqualified for conduct which a Range Officer deems to be unsportsmanlike. Examples include, but are not limited to, cheating, dishonesty, failing to comply with the reasonable directions of a Match Official, or any behavior likely to bring the sport into disrepute. The Range Master must be notified as soon as possible.  
10.6.2  A competitor who is deemed by a Range Officer to have intentionally removed or caused the loss of eye or ear protection in order to gain a reshoot or advantage will be disqualified.  
10.6.3  Other persons may be expelled from the range for conduct which a Range Officer deems to be unacceptable. Examples include, but are not limited to, failing to comply with the reasonable directions of a Match Official, interference with the operation of a course of fire and/or a competitor's attempt thereof, and any other behavior likely to bring the sport into disrepute.  
10.7  Disqualification – Prohibited Substances  
10.7.1  All persons are required to be in complete control both mentally and physically during IPSC matches.  
10.7.2  IPSC considers the abuse of alcoholic products, non-prescription and non-essential drugs and the use of illegal or performance enhancing drugs, irrespective of how they are taken or administered, to be an extremely serious offense.  
10.7.3  Except when used for medicinal purposes, competitors and officials at matches must not be affected by drugs (including alcohol) of any sort during matches. Any person, who in the opinion of the Range Master is visibly under the influence of any of the items described herein, will be disqualified from the match and may be required to leave the range.  
10.7.4  IPSC reserves the right to prohibit any general or specific substances and to introduce tests for the presence of these substances at any time (see separate IPSC Anti-Doping Rules).  

CHAPTER 11: Arbitration and Interpretation of Rules 
11.1 General Principles 
11.1.1 Administration – Occasional disputes are inevitable in any competitive activity governed by rules. It is recognized that at the more significant match levels the outcome is much more important to the individual competitor. However, effective match administration and planning will prevent most if not all disputes. 
11.1.2 Access – Appeals may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the following rules for any matter except where specifically denied by another rule. Appeals arising from a disqualification for a safety infraction will only be accepted to determine whether exceptional circumstances warrant reconsideration of the disqualification. However, the commission of the infraction as described by the Match Official is not subject to challenge or appeal. 
11.1.3 Appeals – The Range Officer makes decisions initially. If the appellant disagrees with a decision, the Chief Range Officer for the stage or area in question should be asked to rule. If a disagreement still exists, the Range Master must be asked to rule. 
11.1.4 Appeal to Committee – Should the appellant continue to disagree with the decision he may appeal to the Arbitration Committee by submitting a first party appeal. 
11.1.5 Retain Evidence – An appellant is required to inform the Range Master of his wish to present his appeal to the Arbitration Committee and may request that the officials retain any and all relevant documentary or other evidence pending the hearing. Audio and/or video recordings may be accepted as evidence. 
11.1.6 Preparing the Appeal – The appellant is responsible for the preparation and delivery of the written submission, together with the appropriate fee. Both must be submitted to the Range Master within the specified period of time. 
11.1.7 Match Official’s Duty – Any Match Official in receipt of a request for arbitration must, without delay, inform the Range Master and must note the identities of all witnesses and officials involved and pass this information on to the Range Master. 
11.1.8 Match Director’s Duty – Upon receiving the appeal from the Range Master, the Match Director must convene the Arbitration Committee in a place of privacy as soon as possible. 
11.1.9 Arbitration Committee’s Duty – The Arbitration Committee is bound to observe and apply the current IPSC Rules and to deliver a decision consistent with those rules. Where rules require interpretation or where an incident is not specifically covered by the rules, the Arbitration Committee will use their best judgment in the spirit of the rules. 
11.2 Composition of Committee 
11.2.1 Level III or Higher Matches – The composition of an Arbitration Committee will be subject to the following rules: 
11.2.1.1 The IPSC President, or his delegate, or a certified Match Official appointed by the Match Director, (in that order) will serve as Chairman of the committee with no vote. 
11.2.1.2 Three arbitrators will be appointed by the IPSC President, or his delegate, or by the Match Director, (in that order), with one vote each. 
11.2.1.3 When possible arbitrators should be competitors in the match and should be certified Match Officials. 
11.2.1.4 Under no circumstances must the Chairman or any member of an Arbitration Committee be a party to the original decision or subsequent appeals, which led to the arbitration. 
11.2.2 Level I and II Matches – The Match Director can appoint an Arbitration Committee of three experienced persons who are not parties to the appeal and who do not have a direct conflict of interest in the outcome of the appeal. The arbitrators should be certified Match Officials if possible. All committee members will vote. The senior Match Official, or the senior person if there are no Match Officials, will be the chairman. 
11.3  Time Limits and Sequences  
11.3.1  Time Limit for Appeal to Arbitration – Written appeals to arbitration must be submitted to the Range Master on the appropriate form, accompanied by the applicable fee, within one hour of the time of the disputed call as recorded by Match Officials.

11.3.2  Decision Time Limit – The Committee must reach a decision within 24 hours of the request for arbitration or before the results have been declared final by the Match Director, whichever comes first. If the Committee fails to render a decision within the prescribed period, both a first and third party appellant (see Rule 11.7.1) will automatically succeed in their appeal, and the fee will be returned.  
11.4  Fees  
11.4.1  Amount – For Level III or higher matches, the appeal fee to enable an appellant to appeal to arbitration will be US$100.00 or the equivalent of the maximum individual match entry fee (whichever is lower), in local currency. The appeal fee for other matches may be set by the Match Organizers, but must not exceed US$100 or equivalent in local currency. An appeal brought by the Range Master in respect of a match issue will not incur a fee.  
11.4.2  Disbursement – If the Committee's decision is to uphold the appeal, the fee paid will be returned. If the Committee's decision is to deny the appeal, the appeal fee and the decision must be forwarded to the Regional or National Range Officers Institute (RROI or NROI) in respect of Level I and II matches, and to the International Range Officers Association (IROA) in respect of Level III and higher matches.
