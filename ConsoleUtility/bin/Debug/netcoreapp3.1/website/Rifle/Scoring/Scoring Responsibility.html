<h1>9.8 Scoring Responsibility</h1>

<h5>9.8.1 </h5>
Each competitor has a responsibility to maintain an accurate record of their scores by verifying the lists posted by the Stats Officer.
<h5>9.8.2 </h5>
After all competitors have completed a match, the provisional stage results must be published and posted in a conspicuous place at the shooting range and, at Level IV or higher matches, at the official match hotel for the purpose of verification by competitors. The time and date the subject results were actually posted (not just printed) at each venue must be clearly stated thereon.
<h5>9.8.3 </h5>
If a competitor detects an error in those results, he must file an appeal with the Stats Officer within 1 hour after the results were actually posted. If the appeal is not filed within the time limit, the posted scores will stand and the appeal will be dismissed.
<h5>9.8.4 </h5>
Competitors who are scheduled (or otherwise authorized by the Match Director) to complete all courses of fire in a match in a period of time less than the full duration of the match (e.g. 1 day format in a 3 day match etc.), are required to check their provisional match results in accordance with the special procedures and time limits specified by the Match Director (e.g. via a website), failing which scoring appeals will not be accepted. The relevant procedure must be published in advance in match literature and/or by way of a notice posted in a conspicuous place at the shooting range prior to commencement of the match (also see Section 6.6).
<h5>9.8.5 </h5>
A Match Director may elect to have results posted electronically (e.g. via a website) either in addition to, or as an alternative to, physically printing them. If so, the relevant procedure must be published in advance in match literature and/or by way of a notice posted in a conspicuous place at the shooting range prior to commencement of the match. Facilities (e.g. a computer) must be provided for competitors to view the results if a Match Director has elected to only have results posted electronically.
