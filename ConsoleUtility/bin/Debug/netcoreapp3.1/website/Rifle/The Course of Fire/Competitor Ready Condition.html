<h1>8.2 Competitor Ready Condition</h1>

<h5>8.2.1 </h5>
The rifle is prepared, made safe and held or placed as specified in the written stage briefing.
<h5>8.2.2 </h5>
Unless specified in the written stage briefing, the competitor-s stance prior to the commencement of the course of fire must be standing erect, with the rifle in the ready condition, held in both hands, stock touching the competitor at hip level, barrel parallel to the ground, trigger guard downwards, muzzle pointing downrange and with the fingers outside the trigger guard. This applies to all rifle ready conditions, unless otherwise specified in the written stage briefing.
<h6>8.2.2.1 </h6>
Unless otherwise stated in the written stage briefing holding the gun upside down is not acceptable.
<h6>8.2.2.2 </h6>
A competitor who attempts or completes a course of fire where an incorrect start position was used may be required by a Range Officer to reshoot the course of fire.
<h6>8.2.2.3 </h6>
Different stages may require the "ready position" to be prone, kneeling, sitting or as otherwise stated in the written stage briefing. However, the "ready condition" of the rifle stipulated here and the general outline of the "ready position" will prevail.
<h6>8.2.2.4 </h6>
A course of fire must never permit a competitor to start a stage with the rifle mounted into the shoulder and pointing towards targets.
<h5>8.2.3 </h5>
A course of fire must never require or allow a competitor to touch or hold a magazine, loading device or ammunition, other than a magazine fitted to the rifle, after the "Standby" command and before the Start Signal (except for unavoidable touching with the lower arms).
