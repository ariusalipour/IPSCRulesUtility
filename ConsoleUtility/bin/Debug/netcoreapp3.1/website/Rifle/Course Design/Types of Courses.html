<h5>1.2.2 </h5>
Special Courses of Fire:
<h6>1.2.2.1 Classifiers</h6>
Courses of fire authorized by a Regional Director and/or IPSC, which are available to competitors seeking a regional and/or international classification. Classifiers must be set up in accordance with these rules and be conducted strictly in accordance with the notes and diagrams accompanying them. Results must be submitted to the authorizing entity in the format required (with the applicable fees, if any), in order for them to be recognized.
<h6>1.2.2.2 </h6>
Shoot-Off - An event conducted separately from a match. Two eligible competitors simultaneously engage two identical and adjacent target arrays in a process of one or more elimination bouts (see Appendix A3). It is recommended that metal targets be used, and that the final target for each competitor is set so that it overlaps that of the other competitor when struck down, with the winner being the competitor whose target is on the bottom. Each target array must not exceed 6 rounds for Manual Action Divisions, and 12 rounds for Semi Auto Divisions and each competitor may be required to perform a mandatory reload after shooting at his first target, and before he shoots at his final target. Violations are subject to automatic forfeiture of the bout.
