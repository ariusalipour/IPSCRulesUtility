<h1>5.2 Holster and Other Competitor Equipment</h1>

<h5>5.2.1 </h5>
Carry and storage - handguns must be carried unloaded, in a case or bag of a design intended or suitable for the safe carriage of firearms, or in a holster securely attached to the competitor's belt. Violations are subject to Rule 10.5.13.
<h6>5.2.1.1 </h6>
Competitors arriving at an IPSC match in possession of a loaded firearm must immediately report to a Range Officer, who will supervise unloading of the firearm. Competitors failing to comply may be subject to Rule 10.5.13.
<h6>5.2.1.2 </h6>
Handguns carried in a holster must have an empty magazine well, and the hammer or striker must be decocked. Violations will incur a warning for the first occurrence, but will be subject to Rule 10.6.1 for subsequent occurrences in the same match.
<h5>5.2.2 Handling</h5>
Except when within the boundaries of a Safety Area, or when under the supervision and direct command of a Range Officer, competitors must not handle their firearms. The word "handle" includes holstering or unholstering a firearm, even if it is concealed by a protective cover, and/or adding or removing it to/from the competitor's person while it is wholly or partially holstered. Violations are subject to Rule 10.5.1.
<h5>5.2.3 </h5>
Unless otherwise specified in the written stage briefing, the belt carrying the holster and all allied equipment must be worn at waist level. The belt or the inner belt or both must be either permanently sewn at the waist, or secured with a minimum of three belt loops attached to shorts or trousers.
<h6>5.2.3.1 </h6>
Female competitors in all Divisions are subject to the same conditions as above, except that the belt carrying the holster and all allied equipment may be worn at hip level. If another belt is worn at waist level, the holster and all allied equipment must be placed on the lower belt.
<h5>5.2.4 </h5>
Spare ammunition, magazines and speed loaders should be carried in retention devices specifically designed for that purpose. Carriage of additional magazines and speed loaders in rear pockets of shorts or trousers is also approved.
<h6>5.2.4.1 </h6>
When a Competitor Ready Condition requires that magazines or speed loaders be placed on a table or similar, the competitor may retrieve and carry those items anywhere on their person after the Start Signal, and this will not be treated as contravention of Divisional equipment placement rules.
<h6>5.2.4.2 </h6>
Unless specified in the written stage briefing, or unless required by a Range Officer, the position of the holster and allied equipment must not be moved or changed by a competitor from stage to stage.
<h5>5.2.5 </h5>
Where a Division specifies a maximum distance that a competitor's handgun and equipment may extend away from a competitor's body, a Range Officer may check compliance by measuring the closest distance between the competitor's torso and the center of the longest dimension of the handgun grip and/or any reloading devices.
<h6>5.2.5.1 </h6>
The measurement is to be taken while the competitor is standing relaxed (see Appendix E2).
<h6>5.2.5.2 </h6>
Any competitor who fails the foregoing test prior to the Start Signal will be required to immediately adjust his holster or allied equipment to comply with the requirements of the relevant Division. The Range Master may make allowances for variations in these requirements due to anatomical considerations. Some competitors may not be able to fully comply.
<h5>5.2.6 </h5>
Handgun matches must not require the use of a particular type or brand of holster or allied equipment. However, the Range Master may deem that a competitor's holster is unsafe and order that the item be improved to his satisfaction, failing which it must be withdrawn from the match. If a retaining strap or flap is attached to a holster and/or allied equipment, it must be applied or closed prior to issuance of the "Standby" command (see Rule 8.3.3).
<h5>5.2.7 </h5>
Competitors must not be permitted to commence a course of fire wearing more than one holster or:
<h6>5.2.7.1 </h6>
A shoulder holster or "tie-down" rig (visible or otherwise), except as specified in Rule 5.2.8;
<h6>5.2.7.2 </h6>
A holster with the heel of the butt of the handgun below the top of the belt (see Appendix E3b), except as specified in Rule 5.2.8;
<h6>5.2.7.3 </h6>
A holster which permits the muzzle of a holstered handgun to point further than 1 meter from the competitor's feet while standing relaxed;
<h6>5.2.7.4 </h6>
A holster which does not completely prevent access to, or activation of, the trigger of the handgun while holstered, or a holster which requires use of the trigger finger to unlock or release the handgun when drawing.
<h5>5.2.8 </h5>
Competitors deemed by the Match Director to be active law enforcement officers or military personnel may be entitled to use their duty holster and allied equipment. However, the Range Master will remain the final authority in respect of the safety and suitability of using such equipment at IPSC matches.
<h5>5.2.9 </h5>
Competitors deemed by the Range Master to be permanently and significantly disabled may be given special dispensation in relation to the type and/or placement of their holster and allied equipment, and the Range Master will remain the final authority in respect of the safety and suitability of using such equipment at IPSC matches.
<h5>5.2.10 </h5>
In some Divisions (see Appendix D), neither the handgun, nor any of its attachments, nor the holster, nor any allied equipment, can extend forward of the line illustrated in Appendix E2 at the Start Signal. Any such items a Range Officer deems not to be in compliance must be safely and promptly adjusted, failing which Rule 6.2.5.1 will apply.
