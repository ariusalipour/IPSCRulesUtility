<h1>5.6 Chronograph and Power Factors</h1>

<h5>5.6.1 </h5>
The power factors for each Division are stipulated in Appendix D. One or more official match chronographs must be used to assist in the determination of the power factor of each competitor's ammunition. In the absence of chronographs, the power factor declared by a competitor cannot be challenged.
<h6>5.6.1.1 </h6>
The power factor rating to enable a competitor's scores to be included in match results is called "Minor". The power factor floor for Minor rating, and other specific requirements applicable to each Division, are stipulated in Appendix D.
<h6>5.6.1.2 </h6>
Some Divisions offer a higher power factor rating called "Major", which enables competitors to earn more points for peripheral shots on scoring paper targets. The power factor floor for Major rating, if available, and other specific requirements applicable to each Division, are stipulated in Appendix D.
<h6>5.6.1.3 </h6>
The associated values awarded for Minor and Major scoring hits are illustrated in Appendices B and C. The method used to determine power factor is explained in the following section.
<h5>5.6.2 </h5>
The chronograph must be properly set up in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and verified each day by Match Officials in the following manner:
<h6>5.6.2.1 </h6>
At the beginning of the first day of the match, a Range Officer will fire 3 rounds from the supply of the official match calibration ammunition through the calibration firearm over the chronograph, and the average velocity of the 3 rounds will be recorded;
<h6>5.6.2.2 </h6>
On each of the following match days, the process will be repeated using the same firearm and ammunition supply (ideally from the same factory lot);
<h6>5.6.2.3 </h6>
The chronograph will be deemed to be within tolerance if the daily average velocity is within +/-5% of the average velocity achieved in Rule 5.6.2.1;
<h6>5.6.2.4 </h6>
Should a daily variance exceed the allowable tolerance stated above, the Range Master will take whatever steps he deems necessary to rectify the situation. A sample form suitable for recording daily readings appears in Appendix C4;
<h6>5.6.2.5 </h6>
The official match bullet scale(s) should be initially calibrated, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, when the first squad arrives for testing each day and again immediately before each subsequent squad is tested (see Rule 5.6.3);
<h5>5.6.3 </h5>
Competitor Ammunition Testing Procedure
<h6>5.6.3.1 </h6>
Ammunition must be tested using the competitor's firearm. Moreover, prior to and/or during testing, the competitor's firearm and the component parts thereof must not be altered or modified in any way from the condition it is being used (or will be used) at the match. Violations will be subject to Section 10.6.
<h6>5.6.3.2 </h6>
An initial 8 sample rounds for the chronograph test will be drawn from each competitor at a time and place determined by Match Officials, who may require additional tests of a competitor's ammunition at any time during the match.
<h6>5.6.3.3 </h6>
From the 8 sample rounds drawn by Match Officials, 1 bullet is removed and weighed to determine the actual bullet weight, and 3 bullets are fired over the chronograph. If a competitor has rounds of different bullet weights in his possession, 8 sample rounds of each may be drawn for testing. The lowest power factor achieved during testing will be applied to all his scores in the match. All digits visible on the scales and chronograph displays must be used at face value (i.e. without rounding or truncation), for the calculation in Rule 5.6.3.5. In the absence of a bullet puller and scales, the competitor's declared bullet weight will be used.
<h6>5.6.3.4 </h6>
If bullet weighing is conducted in advance of a competitor's arrival, weighed bullets must be retained by the chronograph station with the competitor's remaining sample rounds, until the competitor or their delegate has attended the chronograph station and completed testing. If a competitor challenges the weight of a bullet pre-weighed before his arrival, he is entitled to have the scales calibrated, and the test bullet reweighed, in his presence.
<h6>5.6.3.5 </h6>
Power factor is calculated using the bullet weight and the average velocity of the 3 rounds fired, according to the following formula:
<h6>5.6.3.6 </h6>
If the resultant power factor fails to meet the declared power factor floor, another 3 rounds will be fired over the chronograph. The power factor will be recalculated using the bullet weight and the average velocity of the 3 highest velocity rounds from the 6 rounds fired.
<h6>5.6.3.7 </h6>
If the power factor is still insufficient, the competitor may elect to have his final bullet:
<h6>5.6.3.8 </h6>
If the resultant power factor fails to meet the Major power factor floor of the relevant Division, the competitor's scores will be recalculated as Minor, if achieved.
<h6>5.6.3.9 </h6>
If the resultant power factor fails to meet the minimum power factor floor for the relevant Division, the competitor may continue shooting the match, but his scores will not be entered into match results nor count for match recognition and awards.
<h6>5.6.3.10 </h6>
If a competitor's ammunition is retested, or if any authorized replacement ammunition is used, and different power factors are recorded when tested according to these rules, the lower power factor must be applied to score all courses of fire, including those already completed by the competitor.
<h6>5.6.3.11 </h6>
The scores of a competitor who, for any reason, fails to present his firearm for testing at the designated time and location and/or who fails to provide sample rounds for testing whenever requested by a Match Official, will be removed from the match results.
<h6>5.6.3.12 </h6>
If the Range Master deems that a chronograph has become inoperative, and further testing of competitor's ammunition is not possible, the power factors of competitors which have been successfully tested will stand, and the Major or Minor power factor declared by all other competitors who have not been tested will be accepted without challenge, subject to any applicable Division requirements (see Appendix D).
