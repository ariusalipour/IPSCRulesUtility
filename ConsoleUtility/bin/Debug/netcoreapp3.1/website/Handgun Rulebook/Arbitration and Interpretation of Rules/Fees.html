<h1>11.4 Fees</h1>

<h5>11.4.1 </h5>
Amount - For Level III or higher matches, the appeal fee to enable an appellant to appeal to arbitration will be US$100.00 or the equivalent of the maximum individual match entry fee (whichever is lower), in local currency. The appeal fee for other matches may be set by the Match Organizers, but must not exceed US$100 or equivalent in local currency. An appeal brought by the Range Master in respect of a match issue will not incur a fee.
<h5>11.4.2 </h5>
Disbursement - If the Committee's decision is to uphold the appeal, the fee paid will be returned. If the Committee's decision is to deny the appeal, the appeal fee and the decision must be forwarded to the Regional or National Range Officers Institute (RROI or NROI) in respect of Level I and II matches, and to the International Range Officers Association (IROA) in respect of Level III and higher matches.
