<h1>11.1 General Principles</h1>

<h5>11.1.1 Administration</h5>
Occasional disputes are inevitable in any competitive activity governed by rules. It is recognized that at the more significant match levels the outcome is much more important to the individual competitor. However, effective match administration and planning will prevent most if not all disputes.
<h5>11.1.2 Access</h5>
Appeals may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the following rules for any matter except where specifically denied by another rule. Appeals arising from a disqualification for a safety infraction will only be accepted to determine whether exceptional circumstances warrant reconsideration of the disqualification. However, the commission of the infraction as described by the Match Official is not subject to challenge or appeal.
<h5>11.1.3 Appeals</h5>
The Range Officer makes decisions initially. If the appellant disagrees with a decision, the Chief Range Officer for the stage or area in question should be asked to rule. If a disagreement still exists, the Range Master must be asked to rule.
<h5>11.1.4 Appeal to Committee</h5>
Should the appellant continue to disagree with the decision he may appeal to the Arbitration Committee by submitting a first party appeal.
<h5>11.1.5 Retain Evidence</h5>
An appellant is required to inform the Range Master of his wish to present his appeal to the Arbitration Committee and may request that the officials retain any and all relevant documentary or other evidence pending the hearing. Audio and/or video recordings may be accepted as evidence.
<h5>11.1.6 Preparing the Appeal</h5>
The appellant is responsible for the preparation and delivery of the written submission, together with the appropriate fee. Both must be submitted to the Range Master within the specified period of time.
<h5>11.1.7 </h5>
Match Official's Duty - Any Match Official in receipt of a request for arbitration must, without delay, inform the Range Master and must note the identities of all witnesses and officials involved and pass this information on to the Range Master.
<h5>11.1.8 </h5>
Match Director's Duty - Upon receiving the appeal from the Range Master, the Match Director must convene the Arbitration Committee in a place of privacy as soon as possible.
<h5>11.1.9 </h5>
Arbitration Committee's Duty - The Arbitration Committee is bound to observe and apply the current IPSC Rules and to deliver a decision consistent with those rules. Where rules require interpretation or where an incident is not specifically covered by the rules, the Arbitration Committee will use their best judgment in the spirit of the rules.
