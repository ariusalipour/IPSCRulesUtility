<h1>8.6 Assistance or Interference</h1>

<h5>8.6.1 </h5>
No assistance of any kind can be given to a competitor during a course of fire, except that any Range Officer assigned to a stage may issue safety warnings to a competitor at any time. Such warnings will not be grounds for the competitor to be awarded a reshoot.
<h6>8.6.1.1 </h6>
Competitors confined to wheelchairs or similar devices may be given special dispensation by the Range Master in respect of mobility assistance. However, the provisions of Rule 10.2.10 may still apply, at the Range Master's discretion.
<h5>8.6.2 </h5>
Any person providing assistance to a competitor during a course of fire without the prior approval of a Range Officer (and the competitor receiving such assistance) may, at the discretion of a Range Officer, incur a procedural penalty for that stage and/or be subject to Section 10.6.
<h5>8.6.3 </h5>
Any person verbally or otherwise interfering with a competitor during his attempt at a course of fire may be subject to Section 10.6. If the Range Officer believes that the interference significantly affected the competitor, he must report the incident to the Range Master, who may, at his discretion, offer the affected competitor a reshoot.
<h5>8.6.4 </h5>
In the event that inadvertent contact with the Range Officer, or another external influence, has interfered with the competitor during a course of fire, the Range Officer may offer the competitor a reshoot of the course of fire. The competitor must accept or decline the offer prior to seeing either the time or the score from the initial attempt. However, if the competitor commits a safety infraction during any such interference, the provisions of Sections 10.4 and 10.5 may still apply.
<h5>8.6.5 </h5>
In the event that any person appears downrange from the competitor during a course of fire, it must immediately be terminated and the competitor required to reshoot the course of fire. If the competitor notices the problem before the Range Officer, he must immediately self-stop, cease firing, point his firearm in a safe direction and wait for further instructions from the Range Officer. However, if the competitor fails to comply with the above procedure, the provisions of Sections 10.4 and 10.5 will apply.
<h5>8.6.6 </h5>
Drones or other remotely controlled devices are prohibited unless their use is approved in advance by the Match Director.
