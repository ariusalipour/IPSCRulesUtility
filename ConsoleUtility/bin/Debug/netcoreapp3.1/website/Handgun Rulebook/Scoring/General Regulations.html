<h1>9.1 General Regulations</h1>

<h5>9.1.1 Approaching Targets</h5>
While scoring is in progress, competitors or their delegate must not approach any target closer than 1 meter without the authorization of the Range Officer. Violation will result in a warning for the first offense, but the competitor or his delegate may, at the discretion of the Range Officer, incur a procedural penalty for subsequent occurrences in the same match.
<h5>9.1.2 Touching Targets</h5>
While scoring is in progress competitors or their delegate must not touch, gauge or otherwise interfere with any target without the authorization of the Range Officer. Should a Range Officer deem that a competitor or their delegate has influenced or affected the scoring process due to such interference, the Range Officer may:
<h6>9.1.2.1 </h6>
Score the affected target as a missed target; or
<h6>9.1.2.2 </h6>
Impose penalties for any affected no-shoots.
<h5>9.1.3 Prematurely Patched Targets</h5>
If a target is prematurely patched or taped, preventing the determination of the actual score, the Range Officer must order the competitor to reshoot the course of fire.
<h5>9.1.4 Unrestored Targets</h5>
If, following completion of a course of fire by a previous competitor, one or more targets have not been properly patched or taped for the competitor being scored, the Range Officer must judge whether or not an accurate score can be determined. If there are extra scoring hits or questionable penalty hits thereon, and it is not obvious which hits were made by the competitor being scored, the affected competitor must be ordered to reshoot the course of fire.
<h6>9.1.4.1 </h6>
In the event that patches or tape applied to a restored paper target are accidentally blown off by wind, muzzle blast or another reason, and it is not obvious to the Range Officer which hits were made by the competitor being scored, the competitor will be required to reshoot the course of fire.
<h6>9.1.4.2 </h6>
A competitor who hesitates or self-stops during his attempt at a course of fire, due to a belief that one or more targets have not been restored or reset, is not entitled to a reshoot.
<h5>9.1.5 Impenetrable</h5>
The scoring area of all IPSC scoring targets and no-shoots is deemed to be impenetrable. If a:
<h6>9.1.5.1 </h6>
Bullet strikes wholly within the scoring area of a paper target, and continues on to strike the scoring area of another paper target, the hit on the subsequent paper target will not count for score or penalty, as the case may be.
<h6>9.1.5.2 </h6>
Bullet strikes wholly within the scoring area of a paper target, and continues on to hit or strike down a metal target, this will be treated as range equipment failure. The competitor will be required to reshoot the course of fire, after it has been restored.
<h6>9.1.5.3 </h6>
Bullet strikes partially within the scoring area of a paper or metal target, and continues on to strike the scoring area of another paper target, the hit on the subsequent paper target will also count for score or penalty, as the case may be.
<h6>9.1.5.4 </h6>
Bullet strikes partially within the scoring area of a paper or metal target, and continues on to strike down (or hit the scoring area of) another metal target, the fallen (or hit on the) subsequent metal target will also count for score or penalty, as the case may be.
<h5>9.1.6 Hard Cover</h5>
Unless specifically described as "soft cover" (see Rule 4.1.4.2) in the written stage briefing, all props, walls, barriers, vision screens and other obstacles are deemed to be impenetrable "hard cover". If a:
<h6>9.1.6.1 </h6>
Bullet strikes wholly within hard cover, and continues on to strike any scoring paper target or no-shoot, that shot will not count for score or penalty, as the case may be. If it cannot be determined which hit(s) on a scoring paper target or no-shoot are the result of shots fired through hard cover, the scoring paper target or no-shoot will be scored by ignoring the applicable number of highest scoring hit(s).
<h6>9.1.6.2 </h6>
Bullet strikes wholly within hard cover, and continues on to hit or strike down a metal target, this will be treated as range equipment failure (see Rule 4.6.1). The competitor will be required to reshoot the course of fire, after it has been restored.
<h6>9.1.6.3 </h6>
Bullet strikes partially within hard cover, and continues on to strike the scoring area of a paper target, the hit on that paper target will count for score or penalty, as the case may be.
<h6>9.1.6.4 </h6>
Bullet strikes partially within hard cover, and continues on to strike down a scoring metal target, the fallen target will count for score. If a bullet strikes partially within hard cover, and continues on to strike down or hit a metal no-shoot, the fallen no-shoot or hit thereon will count for penalty.
<h5>9.1.7 Target Sticks</h5>
Are neither Hard Cover nor Soft Cover. Shots which have passed wholly or partially through target sticks and which hit a paper or metal target will count for score or penalty, as the case may be.
