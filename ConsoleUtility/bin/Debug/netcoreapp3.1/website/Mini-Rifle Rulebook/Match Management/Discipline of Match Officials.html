<h5>7.2.2 </h5>
In the event that a Match Official is disciplined, the Range Master must send a report of the incident and details of the disciplinary action to the Match Official's Regional Director, the Regional Director of the Region hosting the match, and to the President of the International Range Officers Association (IROA).
<h5>7.2.3 </h5>
A Match Official who is disqualified from a match for a safety infraction while competing will continue to be eligible to serve as a Match Official for the match. The Range Master will make any decision related to an official's participation.
