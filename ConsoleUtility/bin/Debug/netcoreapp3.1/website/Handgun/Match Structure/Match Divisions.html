<h1>6.2 Match Divisions</h1>

<h5>6.2.1 </h5>
IPSC Divisions recognize different firearms and equipment (see Appendix D). Each match must recognize at least one Division. When multiple Divisions are available in a match, each Division must be scored separately and independently, and match results must recognize a winner in each Division.
<h5>6.2.2 </h5>
In IPSC sanctioned matches, the minimum number of competitors stipulated in Appendix A2 must compete in each Division for it to be recognized. If there are insufficient competitors in a Division, the Match Director may allow that Division to stand without official IPSC recognition.
<h5>6.2.3 </h5>
Prior to the commencement of a match, each competitor must declare one Division for score, and Match Officials should check competitor equipment compliance with the declared Division, prior to the competitor making an attempt at any of the courses of fire. This is a service to assist competitors verify that their equipment, in the configuration as presented, is in compliance with their declared Division. However, competitors always remain subject to the provisions of Rule 6.2.5.1.
<h6>6.2.3.1 </h6>
If a competitor disagrees with an equipment compliance ruling, the onus is upon him, prior to him attempting any courses of fire, to provide evidence acceptable to the examiner in support of his claim. In the absence or rejection of such evidence, the original decision will stand, subject only to appeal to the Range Master, whose decision is final.
<h6>6.2.3.2 </h6>
The competitor's firearm and all allied equipment accessible to him during a course of fire are subject to compliance testing, if requested by a Match Official.
<h5>6.2.4 </h5>
Subject to the prior approval of the Match Director, a competitor may enter a match in more than one Division. However, the competitor may compete for score in only one Division, and that must be the first attempt in all cases. Any subsequent attempts in another Division will not be entered into match results nor count for match recognition and awards.
<h5>6.2.5 </h5>
Where a Division is unavailable or deleted, or where a competitor fails to declare a specific Division prior to the commencement of a match, the competitor will be placed in the Division which, in the opinion of the Range Master, most closely identifies with the competitor's equipment. If, in the opinion of the Range Master, no suitable Division is available, the competitor will shoot the match for no score.
<h6>6.2.5.1 </h6>
A competitor who fails to satisfy the maximum distance of handgun and allied equipment from his torso (see Appendices D1-5), or the foremost limit for handgun, holster and allied equipment (see Appendix E2), requirements of a declared Division after the Start Signal will incur a warning for the first offense. Subsequent occurrences in the same match will result in the competitor being placed in Open Division, if available, otherwise the competitor's scores will not be entered into match results. Competitors already registered in Open Division who fail to comply with the above requirements after the Start Signal will incur a warning for the first offense, but will not have their scores entered into match results for subsequent occurrences in the same match. A competitor who fails to satisfy the equipment or other requirements, with the exception of those listed above, of a declared Division after the Start Signal, will be placed in Open Division, if available, otherwise the competitor's scores will not be entered into match results. Competitors already registered in Open Division who fail to comply with the requirements, with the exception of those listed above, of Open Division after the Start Signal will not have their scores entered into match results. This rule does not apply for measurements done under Rule 5.2.5, either before (see Rule
<h6>6.2.5.2 </h6>
A competitor who is classified or reclassified as above must be notified as soon as possible. The Range Master's decision on these matters is final.
<h6>6.2.5.3 </h6>
A competitor reclassified to Open Division under Rule 6.2.5.1 will thereafter be subject only to the provisions of Appendix D1 but is required to continue using the same firearm and sights, unless Rule 5.1.7 applies. If the competitor's ammunition satisfies the requirements for Open Major power factor, his scores for the entire match will be adjusted accordingly.
<h5>6.2.6 </h5>
A disqualification incurred by a competitor, at any time during a match, will prevent the competitor from further participation in the match including any subsequent attempts in another Division. However, this is not retroactive. Any previous and complete scores from another Division will be entered into match results for recognition and awards in that Division.
<h5>6.2.7 </h5>
Recognition of a competitor in a specific Division will not preclude further recognition in a Category or from inclusion as member of a Regional or other team.
