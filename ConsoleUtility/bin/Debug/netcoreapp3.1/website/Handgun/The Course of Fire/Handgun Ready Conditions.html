<h1>8.1 Handgun Ready Conditions</h1>
The ready condition for handguns will normally be as stated below. However, in the event that a competitor fails to load the chamber when permitted by the written stage briefing, whether inadvertently or intentionally, the Range Officer must not take any action, as the competitor is always responsible for the handling of the handgun. 
<h5>8.1.1 </h5>
Revolvers:
<h6>8.1.1.1 </h6>
Single Action Only: are not approved for IPSC matches.
<h6>8.1.1.2 </h6>
Double/Selective Action: hammer fully down and cylinder closed. If self-loading pistols prepare "magazine well and chamber empty", revolvers prepare with an empty cylinder, otherwise revolvers prepare with a fully loaded cylinder.
<h6>8.1.1.3 </h6>
Non-traditional revolvers (e.g. those which operate in a "self-loading" mode) are subject to the following rules and/or any other requirements stipulated by the Range Master (also see Appendix D5).
<h5>8.1.2 </h5>
Self-loading Pistols:
<h6>8.1.2.1 </h6>
"Single action" - Chamber loaded, hammer cocked, with external safety applied.
<h6>8.1.2.2 </h6>
"Double action" - Chamber loaded, hammer fully down or decocked.
<h6>8.1.2.3 </h6>
"Selective action" - Chamber loaded, hammer fully down or decocked, or chamber loaded, hammer cocked with external safety applied.
<h6>8.1.2.4 </h6>
For all self-loading pistols, the term "external safety" means the primary visible safety lever on the handgun (e.g. the thumb safety on a "1911" genre handgun). In the event of doubt, the Range Master is the final authority on this matter.
<h6>8.1.2.5 </h6>
If a handgun has a decocking lever, that alone must be used to decock the handgun, without touching the trigger. If a handgun does not have a decocking lever, the hammer must be safely and manually lowered all the way forward (i.e. not just to a "half-cock notch" or to another similar intermediary position).
<h5>8.1.3 </h5>
If a course of fire requires that a self-loading pistol be prepared with an empty chamber, the slide must be fully forward and the hammer, if fitted, must be fully down or decocked (also see Rule 8.1.1.2).
<h6>8.1.3.1 </h6>
When a written stage briefing requires that a competitor's firearm and/or allied equipment be placed on a table or another surface prior to the Start Signal, they must be placed as stipulated in the written stage briefing. Apart from components normally affixed to them (e.g. a thumb rest, thumb safety, racking or cocking handle, base pad etc.), other items must not be used to artificially elevate them (also see Rule 5.1.8).
<h5>8.1.4 </h5>
Unless complying with a Division requirement (see Appendix D), a competitor must not be restricted on the number of rounds to be loaded or reloaded in a handgun. Written stage briefings may only stipulate when the firearm is to be loaded or when mandatory reloads are required, when permitted under Rule 1.1.5.2.
<h5>8.1.5 </h5>
In respect of handguns used at IPSC matches, the following definitions apply:
<h6>8.1.5.1 </h6>
"Single Action" means activation of the trigger causes a single action to occur (i.e. the hammer or striker falls).
<h6>8.1.5.2 </h6>
"Double Action" means activation of the trigger causes more than a single action to occur (i.e. the hammer or striker rises or retracts, then falls).
<h6>8.1.5.3 </h6>
"Selective Action" means that the handgun can be operated in either "Single Action" or "Double Action" modes.
