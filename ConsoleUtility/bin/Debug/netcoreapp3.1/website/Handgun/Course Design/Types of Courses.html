Classifiers must be set up in accordance with these rules and be conducted strictly in accordance with the notes and diagrams accompanying them. Results must be submitted to the authorizing entity in the format required (with the applicable fees, if any), in order for them to be recognized.
<h6>1.2.2.2 </h6>
Shoot-Off - An event conducted separately from a match. Two eligible competitors simultaneously engage two identical and adjacent target arrays in a process of one or more elimination bouts (see Appendix A3). It is recommended that metal targets be used, and that the final target for each competitor is set so that it overlaps that of the other competitor when struck down, with the winner being the competitor whose target is on the bottom. Each target array must not exceed 12 rounds and each competitor must perform a mandatory reload after shooting at his first target, and before he shoots at his final target. Violations are subject to automatic forfeiture of the bout.
