<h1>9.7 Score Sheets</h1>

<h5>9.7.1  (ActionAir | Shotgun | Rifle | MiniRifle | PCC only)</h5>
The Range Officer must enter all information (including any warnings given) on each competitor-s score sheet prior to signing it. After the Range Officer has signed the score sheet, the competitor must add his own signature in the appropriate place. Electronic score sheet signatures will be acceptable if approved by the Regional Director. Whole numbers should be used to record all scores or penalties. The elapsed time taken by the competitor to complete the course of fire must be recorded to 2 decimal places in the appropriate place.
<h5>9.7.2  (ActionAir | Shotgun | Rifle | MiniRifle | PCC only)</h5>
If corrections to the score sheet are required, these will be clearly entered onto the original and other copies of the competitor-s score sheets. The competitor and the Range Officer should initial any corrections.
<h5>9.7.3  (ActionAir | Shotgun | Rifle | MiniRifle | PCC only)</h5>
Should a competitor refuse to sign or initial a score sheet, for any reason, the matter must be referred to the Range Master. If the Range Master is satisfied that the course of fire has been conducted and scored correctly the unsigned score sheet will be submitted as normal for inclusion in the match results.
<h5>9.7.4 </h5>
A score sheet signed by both a competitor and a Range Officer is conclusive evidence that the course of fire has been completed, and that the time, scores and penalties recorded on the score sheet, are accurate and uncontested. The signed score sheet is deemed to be a definitive document and, with the exception of the mutual consent of the competitor and the signatory Range Officer, or due to an arbitration decision, the score sheet will only be changed to correct arithmetical errors or to add procedural penalties under Rule 8.6.2.
<h5>9.7.5 </h5>
If a score sheet is found to have insufficient or excess entries, or if the time has not been recorded on the score sheet, it must be promptly referred to the Range Master who will normally require the competitor to reshoot the course of fire.
<h5>9.7.6 </h5>
In the event that a reshoot is not possible for any reason, the following actions will prevail:
<h6>9.7.6.1 </h6>
If the time is missing, the competitor will receive a zero score for the stage.
<h6>9.7.6.2 </h6>
If insufficient hits or misses have been recorded on the score sheet, those which have been recorded will be deemed complete and conclusive.
<h6>9.7.6.3 </h6>
If excessive hits or misses have been recorded on the score sheet, the highest value scoring hits recorded will be used.
<h6>9.7.6.4 </h6>
Procedural penalties recorded on the score sheet will be deemed complete and conclusive, except where Rule 8.6.2 applies.
<h6>9.7.6.5 </h6>
If the identity of the competitor is missing from a score sheet, it must be referred to the Range Master, who must take whatever action he deems necessary to rectify the situation.
<h5>9.7.7 </h5>
In the event that an original score sheet is lost or otherwise unavailable, the competitor's duplicate copy, or any other written or electronic record acceptable to the Range Master, will be used. If the competitor's copy, or any other written or electronic record, is unavailable, or is deemed by the Range Master to be insufficiently legible the competitor will be required to reshoot the course of fire. If the Range Master deems that a reshoot is not possible for any reason, the competitor will incur a zero time and score for the affected stage.
<h6>9.7.7.1 </h6>
Once a reshoot has been completed, the outcome of the reshoot will stand, even if a record of the original score is subsequently discovered.
<h5>9.7.8 </h5>
No person, other than an authorized Match Official, is permitted to handle an original score sheet retained on a stage, or at any other place, after it has been signed by a competitor and a Range Officer, without the prior approval of the Range Officer or personnel directly involved with Stats. Violations will incur a warning for the first offense, but may be subject to Section 10.6 for subsequent occurrences in the same match.
<h5>9.7.1  (Handgun only)</h5>
The Range Officer must enter all information (including any warnings given) on each competitor's score sheet prior to signing it. After the Range Officer has signed the score sheet, the competitor must add his own signature in the appropriate place. Electronic score sheet signatures will be acceptable if approved by the Regional Director. Whole numbers should be used to record all scores or penalties. The elapsed time taken by the competitor to complete the course of fire must be recorded to 2 decimal places in the appropriate place.
<h5>9.7.2  (Handgun only)</h5>
If corrections to the score sheet are required, these will be clearly entered onto the original and other copies of the competitor's score sheets. The competitor and the Range Officer should initial any corrections.
<h5>9.7.3  (Handgun only)</h5>
