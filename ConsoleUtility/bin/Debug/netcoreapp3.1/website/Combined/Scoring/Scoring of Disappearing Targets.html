<h1>9.9 Scoring of Disappearing Targets</h1>

<h5>9.9.1  (Action Air | Shotgun | Rifle | Mini-Rifle | PCC only)</h5>
Moving targets which present at least a portion of the A zone when at rest (either before or after initial activation), or which continuously appear and disappear for the duration of a competitor-s attempt at a COF, are not disappearing and will always incur failure to engage and/or miss penalties.
<h5>9.9.2  (Action Air | Shotgun | Rifle | Mini-Rifle | PCC only)</h5>
Moving targets, which do not comply with the above criteria, are disappearing and will not incur failure to engage or miss penalties unless a competitor fails to activate the mechanism which initiates the target movement before or when firing his last shot for that course of fire.
<h5>9.9.3 </h5>
Stationary targets which present at least a portion of the A zone, either before or after activation of a moving and/or concealing no-shoot or vision barrier, are not disappearing and will incur failure to engage and/or miss penalties.
<h5>9.9.4  (Action Air | Handgun | Shotgun only)</h5>
Targets which present at least a portion of the A zone each time a competitor operates a mechanical activator (e.g. a rope, lever, pedal, flap, door etc.), are not subject to this section.
<h5>9.9.5 </h5>
If a COF requires that a competitor be confined to an apparatus which travels from one location to another location during his attempt at a COF, any target which can only be engaged from the apparatus for part of its travel, and which cannot subsequently be reengaged, is deemed to be disappearing.
<h5>9.9.1  (Handgun only)</h5>
Moving targets which present at least a portion of the A zone when at rest (either before or after initial activation), or which continuously appear and disappear for the duration of a competitor's attempt at a COF, are not disappearing and will always incur failure to engage and/or miss penalties.
<h5>9.9.2  (Handgun only)</h5>
Moving targets which do not comply with the above criteria are disappearing and will not incur failure to engage or miss penalties unless a competitor fails to activate the mechanism which initiates the target movement before or when firing his last shot for that course of fire.
<h5>9.9.6  (Shotgun only)</h5>
Disappearing frangible targets which the Range Officer deems have not broken due to a direct hit will not count for score. The Range Officer's decision concerning hits or misses is final.
<h5>9.9.4  (Rifle | Mini-Rifle | PCC only)</h5>
Targets which present at least a portion of the A zone each time a competitor operates a mechanical activator
