<h1>5.4 Eye Protection (ActionAir only)</h1>

<h5>5.4.1  (ActionAir only)</h5>
All persons are warned that the correct use of adequate eye protection is in their own interest and of paramount importance to prevent injury to vision. It is strongly recommended that eye protection be worn at all times by all persons while on the range premises.
<h5>5.4.2  (ActionAir only)</h5>
Host organizations may require the use of such protection by all persons, as a condition of attendance and while present on the range premises. If so, Match Officials must make every reasonable effort to ensure that all persons wear adequate protection.
<h5>5.4.3  (ActionAir only)</h5>
If a Range Officer notices that a competitor has lost or displaced their eye protection during a course of fire, or has commenced a course of fire without them, the Range Officer must immediately stop the competitor who will be required to reshoot the course of fire after the protective devices have been restored.
<h5>5.4.4  (ActionAir only)</h5>
A competitor who inadvertently loses eye protection during a course of fire, or commences a course of fire without them, is entitled to stop, point their firearm in a safe direction and indicate the problem to the Range Officer, in which case the provisions of the previous rule will apply.
<h5>5.4.5  (ActionAir only)</h5>
Any attempt to gain a reshoot or advantage by removing eye protection during a course of fire will be considered unsportsmanlike conduct (see Rule 10.6.2).
<h5>5.4.6  (ActionAir only)</h5>
If a Range Officer deems that a competitor about to make an attempt at a course of fire is wearing inadequate eye protection, the Range Officer may order the competitor to rectify the situation before allowing the competitor to continue. The Range Master is the final authority on this matter.
