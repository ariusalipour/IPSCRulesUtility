<h1>10.2 Procedural Penalties - Specific Examples</h1>

<h5>10.2.1 </h5>
A competitor who fires shots while any part of their body is touching the ground or any object beyond a Fault Line will receive 1 procedural penalty for each occurrence. No penalty is assessed if a competitor does not fire any shots while faulting except when Rule 2.2.1.5 applies.
<h6>10.2.1.1 </h6>
However, if the competitor has gained a significant advantage on any target(s) while faulting, he may instead be assessed 1 procedural penalty for each shot fired at the subject target(s) while faulting.
<h5>10.2.2 </h5>
A competitor who fails to comply with a procedure specified in the written stage briefing will incur 1 procedural penalty for each occurrence. However, if a competitor has gained a significant advantage during non-compliance, the competitor may be assessed 1 procedural penalty for each shot fired, instead of a single penalty (e.g. firing one or more shots contrary to the required location, shooting position or stance).
<h5>10.2.3  (ActionAir only)</h5>
Where multiple penalties are assessed in the above cases, they must not exceed the maximum number of scoring hits that can be attained by the competitor. For example, a competitor who gains an advantage while faulting a Fault Line where only 4 rigid targets are visible will receive 1 procedural penalty for each shot fired while faulting, up to a maximum of 4 procedural penalties, regardless of the number of shots actually fired.
<h5>10.2.4 </h5>
A competitor who fails to comply with a mandatory reload will incur 1 procedural penalty for each shot fired after the point where the reload was required until a reload is performed.
<h5>10.2.5 </h5>
In a Cooper Tunnel, a competitor who disturbs one or more pieces of the overhead material will receive 1 procedural penalty for each piece of overhead material which falls. Overhead material which falls as a result of the competitor bumping or striking the uprights, or as a result of muzzle gases or recoil, will not be penalized.
<h5>10.2.6  (ActionAir only)</h5>
A competitor who is creeping (e.g. moving hands towards the firearm, a reloading device or projectile) or physically moving to a more advantageous shooting position or stance after the "Standby" command and prior to issuance of the Start Signal, will incur 1 procedural penalty. If the Range Officer can stop the competitor in time, a warning will be issued for the first offense and the competitor will be restarted.
<h5>10.2.7  (ActionAir only)</h5>
A competitor who fails to engage any scoring target with at least one projectile will incur 1 procedural penalty per target, plus the applicable number of misses, except where the provisions of Rule 9.9.2 apply.
<h5>10.2.8  (ActionAir | Handgun only)</h5>
If a course of fire (or part thereof) stipulates shooting strong or weak hand only, a competitor will incur one procedural penalty for each occurrence of touching the handgun (or scooping it from a table etc.) with the other hand after the Start Signal (or from the point where single hand shooting has been stipulated). Exceptions are releasing an external safety (without scooping), reloading or correcting a malfunction. However, the procedural penalty will be applied on a "per shot fired" basis when a competitor uses the other hand or arm to:
<h6>10.2.8.1  (ActionAir | Handgun only)</h6>
support the handgun or the stipulated wrist, hand or arm while firing shots;
<h6>10.2.8.2  (ActionAir | Handgun only)</h6>
increase stability on the ground, a barricade or another prop while firing shots.
<h5>10.2.9 </h5>
A competitor who leaves a shooting location may return and shoot again from the same location provided they do so safely. However, written stage briefings for Classifiers and Level I & II matches may prohibit such actions, in which case 1 procedural penalty per shot fired will apply.
<h5>10.2.10 </h5>
Special penalty: A competitor unable to fully execute any part of a course of fire due to incapacity or injury may, prior to making his attempt at the course of fire, request that the Range Master apply a penalty in lieu of the stated course requirement.
<h6>10.2.10.1 </h6>
If the request is approved by the Range Master, he must state, in advance of the competitor attempting the course of fire, the extent of the special penalty, ranging from 1% to 20% of the competitor's points "as shot", to be deducted.
<h6>10.2.10.2 </h6>
Alternatively, the Range Master may waive application of any penalties in respect of a competitor who, due to having a significant physical disability, is unable to comply with the stated course requirement.
<h6>10.2.10.3 </h6>
If the request is denied by the Range Master, normal procedural penalties will apply.
<h5>10.2.11 </h5>
A competitor who fires shots over a barrier constructed to a height of at least 1.8 meters will incur 1 procedural penalty for each shot fired (also see Rule 2.2.3.1).
<h5>10.2.3  (Handgun | Shotgun | Rifle | MiniRifle | PCC only)</h5>
Where multiple penalties are assessed in the above cases, they must not exceed the maximum number of scoring hits that can be attained by the competitor. For example, a competitor who gains an advantage while faulting a Fault Line where only 4 metal targets are visible will receive 1 procedural penalty for each shot fired while faulting, up to a maximum of 4 procedural penalties, regardless of the number of shots actually fired.
<h5>10.2.6  (Handgun | Shotgun | Rifle | MiniRifle | PCC only)</h5>
A competitor who is creeping (e.g. moving hands towards the firearm, a reloading device or ammunition) or physically moving to a more advantageous shooting position or stance after the "Standby" command and prior to issuance of the Start Signal, will incur 1 procedural penalty. If the Range Officer can stop the competitor in time, a warning will be issued for the first offense and the competitor will be restarted.
<h5>10.2.7  (Handgun | Shotgun | Rifle | MiniRifle | PCC only)</h5>
A competitor who fails to engage any scoring target with at least one round will incur 1 procedural penalty per target, plus the applicable number of misses, except where the provisions of Rule 9.9.2 apply.
<h5>10.2.8  (Shotgun only)</h5>
If a course of fire stipulates the use of the weak shoulder only, the competitor will be issued procedural penalties for using the strong shoulder. This will be assessed as 1 procedural penalty per shot fired.
<h5>10.2.12  (Shotgun only)</h5>
A competitor who uses ammunition contrary to the type specified for a course of fire, will incur one procedural penalty for each metal target or no-shoot which falls as a result (see Rules 9.5.11, 10.4.9 and 10.4.10).
<h5>10.2.8  (Rifle | MiniRifle | PCC only)</h5>
Not applicable.
<h5>10.2.12  (Rifle | MiniRifle | PCC only)</h5>
Should a competitor engage a target or targets with burst or fully automatic fire (where more than one shot is discharged with one manipulation of the trigger) due to the firearm being in the automatic mode, he will be scored zero for that stage and a warning issued. In the event of a second violation of this rule he will be disqualified. In the event that the discharge was in an unsafe direction or as defined in 10.3.1, the regulations for that Section will apply.
