<h1>6.4 Regional Teams</h1>

<h5>6.4.1 </h5>
Subject to the availability of allocated slots, only one official Regional team in each Division and/or Division/Category may be selected on merit by each Region for IPSC Level IV or higher matches. Approved Category teams are specified by the IPSC Assembly (see Appendix A2).
