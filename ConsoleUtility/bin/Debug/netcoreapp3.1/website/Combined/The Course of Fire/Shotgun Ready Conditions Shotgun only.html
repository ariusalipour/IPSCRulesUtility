<h1>8.1 Shotgun Ready Conditions (Shotgun only)</h1>
The ready condition for shotguns will normally be as stated below. However, in the event that a competitor fails to load the chamber when permitted by the written stage briefing, whether inadvertently or intentionally, the Range Officer must not take any action, as the competitor is always responsible for the handling of the shotgun. 
<h5>8.1.1  (Shotgun only)</h5>
Shotguns:
<h6>8.1.1.1  (Shotgun only)</h6>
Loaded (Option 1): magazine filled and fitted (if applicable), chamber(s) loaded, hammer and/or sear cocked and safety catch applied (if the shotgun is designed to have one).
<h6>8.1.1.2  (Shotgun only)</h6>
Loaded (Option 2): magazine filled and fitted (if applicable), chamber(s) empty and the action closed.
<h6>8.1.1.3  (Shotgun only)</h6>
Unloaded (Option 3): fixed magazine must be empty, detachable magazines removed and chamber(s) must be empty. The action/bolt may be open or closed.
<h5>8.1.2  (ShotgunShotgun only)</h5>
Not applicable.
<h5>8.1.3  (Shotgun only)</h5>
Courses of fire may require ready conditions which are different to those stated above. In such cases, the required ready condition must be clearly stated in the written stage briefing.
<h6>8.1.3.1  (Shotgun only)</h6>
When a written stage briefing requires that a competitor-s firearm and/or allied equipment be placed on a table or another surface prior to the Start Signal, they must be placed as stipulated in the written stage briefing. Apart from components normally affixed to them (e.g. a thumb rest, thumb safety, racking or cocking handle, base pad etc.), other items must not be used to artificially elevate them (also see Rule 5.1.8).
<h5>8.1.4  (Shotgun only)</h5>
Unless complying with a Division requirement (see Appendix D), or Rule 8.1.1, a competitor must not be restricted on the number of rounds to be loaded or reloaded in a shotgun. Written stage briefings may only stipulate when the firearm is to be loaded or when mandatory reloads are required, when permitted under Rule 1.1.5.2.
<h5>8.1.6  (Shotgun only)</h5>
For the initial load prior to the Start Signal the Range Master may require that all rounds be firstly placed in a box or other container to facilitate an easy check on the number and configuration of cartridges to be loaded.
