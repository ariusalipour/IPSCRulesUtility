<h1>8.1 Firearm Ready Conditions (PCC only)</h1>
The ready condition for firearms will normally be as stated below. However, in the event that a competitor fails to load the chamber when permitted by the written stage briefing, whether inadvertently or intentionally, the Range Officer must not take any action, as the competitor is always responsible for the handling of the firearm. 
<h5>8.1.1  (PCC only)</h5>
Pistol Caliber Carbines:
<h6>8.1.1.1  (PCC only)</h6>
Loaded (Option 1): magazine filled and fitted (if applicable), chamber loaded, hammer and/or sear cocked and safety catch applied (if the firearm is designed to have one).
<h6>8.1.1.2  (PCC only)</h6>
Loaded (Option 2): magazine filled and fitted (if applicable), chamber empty and the action closed.
<h6>8.1.1.3  (PCC only)</h6>
Unloaded (Option 3): fixed magazine must be empty, detachable magazines removed and chamber must be empty. The action may be open or closed.
<h5>8.1.2  (PCC only)</h5>
Not applicable.
<h5>8.1.3  (PCC only)</h5>
Courses of fire may require ready conditions which are different to those stated above. In such cases, the required ready condition must be clearly stated in the written stage briefing.
<h6>8.1.3.1  (PCC only)</h6>
When a written stage briefing requires that a competitor-s firearm and/or allied equipment be placed on a table or another surface prior to the Start Signal, they must be placed as stipulated in the written stage briefing. Apart from components normally affixed to them (e.g. a thumb rest, thumb safety, racking or cocking handle, base pad etc.), other items must not be used to artificially elevate them (also see Rule 5.1.8).
<h5>8.1.4  (PCC only)</h5>
Unless complying with a Division requirement (see Appendix D), a competitor must not be restricted on the number of rounds to be loaded or reloaded in a firearm. Written stage briefings may only stipulate when the firearm is to be loaded or when mandatory reloads are required, when permitted under Rule 1.1.5.2.
