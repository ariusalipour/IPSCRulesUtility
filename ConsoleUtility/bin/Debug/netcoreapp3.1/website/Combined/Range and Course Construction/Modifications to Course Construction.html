<h1>2.3 Modifications to Course Construction</h1>

<h5>2.3.1 </h5>
Match Officials may, for any reason, modify the physical construction or stage procedure for a course of fire, provided that such changes are approved in advance by the Range Master. Any such physical changes or additions to a published course of fire should be completed before the stage begins.
<h5>2.3.2 </h5>
All competitors must be notified of any such changes as soon as possible. As a minimum, they must be notified by the official in charge of the course of fire during the squad briefing.
<h5>2.3.3 </h5>
If the Range Master approves any such action after the match begins he must either:
<h6>2.3.3.1  (ActionAir | Shotgun | Rifle | MiniRifle | PCC only)</h6>
Allow the course of fire to continue with the modification affecting only those competitors who have not already completed the stage. If a competitor-s actions caused the change, that competitor must be required to reshoot the revised course of fire, subject to Rule 2.3.4.1; or
<h6>2.3.3.2 </h6>
If possible, require all competitors to complete the course of fire as revised with all previous attempts removed from the match results.
<h6>2.3.3.3 </h6>
A competitor who refuses to reshoot a course of fire, under this or any other Section, when so ordered by a Range Officer, will receive a zero score for that stage, irrespective of any previous attempt.
<h6>2.3.3.1  (Handgun only)</h6>
Allow the course of fire to continue with the modification affecting only those competitors who have not already completed the stage. If a competitor's actions caused the change, that competitor must be required to reshoot the revised course of fire, subject to Rule 2.3.4.1; or
<h5>2.3.4 </h5>
If the Range Master (in consultation with the Match Director) determines that the physical or procedural change results in a loss of competitive equity and it is impossible for all competitors to attempt the revised stage, or if the stage has been rendered unsuitable or unworkable for any reason, that stage and all associated competitor scores must be deleted from the match.
<h6>2.3.4.1 </h6>
A competitor who incurred a disqualification in a stage which is subsequently deleted, may be entitled to reinstatement, if the highest level of appeal pursued by the competitor (i.e. the Range Master or the Arbitration Committee, as the case may be), deems that the disqualification was directly attributable to the reasons for the stage being deleted.
<h5>2.3.5 </h5>
During inclement weather, the Range Master may order that paper targets be fitted with transparent protective covers and/or overhead shelters, and this order is not subject to appeal by competitors (see Rule 6.6.1). Such items must be applied and remain fitted to all affected targets for the same period of time, until the order is rescinded by the Range Master.
<h5>2.3.6 </h5>
If the Range Master (in consultation with the Match Director) deems that climatic or other conditions have, or are likely to, seriously affect the safety and/or conduct of a match, he may order that all shooting activities be suspended, until he issues a "resume shooting" directive.
