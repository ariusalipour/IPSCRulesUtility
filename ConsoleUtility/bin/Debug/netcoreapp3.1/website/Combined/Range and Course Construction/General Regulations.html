<h1>2.1 General Regulations</h1>

<h5>2.1.1 Physical Construction</h5>
Safety considerations in the design, physical construction, and stated requirements for any course of fire are the responsibility of the host organization subject to the approval of the Range Master. Reasonable effort must be made to prevent injury to competitors, officials and spectators during the match. Course design should prevent inadvertent unsafe actions wherever possible. Consideration must be given to the operation of any course of fire to provide suitable access for officials supervising the competitors.
<h5>2.1.2 Safe Angles of Fire</h5>
Courses of fire must always be constructed taking into account safe angles of fire. Consideration must be given to safe target and frame construction and the angle of any possible ricochets. Where appropriate the physical dimensions and suitability of backstops and side berms must be determined as part of the construction process. Unless otherwise specified, the default maximum muzzle angle is 90 degrees in all directions, measured from the front of the competitor facing directly center downrange. Violations are subject to Rule 10.5.2.
<h6>2.1.2.1 </h6>
Subject to the direction and approval of the Regional Director, stage(s) or range specific muzzle angles (reduced or increased) may be permitted. Violations are subject to Rule 10.5.2. Full details of the applicable angles and any conditional factors (e.g. a reduced vertical muzzle angle only applies when a finger is inside the trigger guard), should be published in advance of the match and must be included in the written stage briefings (also see Section 2.3).
<h5>2.1.3  (ActionAir only)</h5>
Whenever rigid targets or rigid hard cover are used in a course of fire, precautions must be taken so that competitors and Match Officials maintain a safe minimum distance from them while they are being shot. Where possible, this should be done with physical barriers. Care should also be taken in respect of props in the line of fire.
<h5>2.1.4 Target Locations</h5>
When a course is constructed to include target locations other than immediately downrange, organizers and officials must protect or restrict surrounding areas to which competitors, officials or spectators have access. Each competitor must be permitted to solve the competitive problem in his own way and must not be hindered by being forced to act in any manner which might cause unsafe action. Targets must be arranged so that shooting at them as presented will not cause competitors to breach safe angles of fire.
<h5>2.1.5 Range Surface</h5>
Where possible, the range surface must be prepared prior to the match, and be kept moderately clear of debris during the match, to provide reasonable safety for competitors and officials. Consideration should be given to the possibility of inclement weather and competitor actions. Match Officials may add gravel, sand or other materials to a deteriorated range surface at any time, and such range maintenance actions may not be appealed by competitors.
<h5>2.1.6 Obstacles</h5>
Natural or created obstacles in a course of fire should reasonably allow for variations in competitors' height and physical build and should be constructed to provide reasonable safety for all competitors, Match Officials and spectators.
<h5>2.1.7 Common Firing Lines</h5>
Courses of fire where multiple competitors are required to fire simultaneously from a common firing line (e.g. Shoot-Off), must provide a minimum of 3 meters of free space between each competitor.
<h5>2.1.8 Target Placement</h5>
Care must be taken with the physical placement of a paper target to prevent a "shoot through".
<h6>2.1.8.1 </h6>
Target placement should be clearly marked on the target stands for target replacement and target stands should be securely fixed or their locations should be clearly marked on the range surface to ensure consistency throughout the entire match. Furthermore, target types should be specified and identified on the target frames or stands prior to the start of the match to ensure that a scoring target is not interchanged with a no-shoot after the match has commenced.
<h6>2.1.8.2  (ActionAir only)</h6>
When paper and rigid targets are used in close proximity in a course of fire, care must be taken to minimize the risk of ricochets from rigid targets.
<h6>2.1.8.3  (ActionAir only)</h6>
When IPSC Action Air Poppers are used in a course of fire, care should be taken to ensure that the location or foundation area is prepared to provide consistent operation throughout the match.
<h6>2.1.8.4  (ActionAir | Handgun | Shotgun only)</h6>
Static targets (i.e. those which are not activated) must not be presented at an angle greater than 90 degrees from the vertical.
<h6>2.1.8.2  (Handgun | Rifle | MiniRifle | PCC only)</h6>
When paper and metal targets are used in close proximity in a course of fire, care must be taken to
<h6>2.1.8.3  (Handgun | Shotgun | Rifle | MiniRifle | PCC only)</h6>
When IPSC Poppers are used in a course of fire, care should be taken to ensure that the location or foundation area is prepared to provide consistent operation throughout the match.
<h6>2.1.8.2  (Shotgun only)</h6>
When paper and metal targets are used in close proximity in a course of fire, care must be taken to minimize the risk of splatter from metal targets.
<h6>2.1.8.4  (Rifle | MiniRifle | PCC only)</h6>
Static targets (i.e. those which are not activated), with the exception of the Universal target, must not be presented at an angle greater than 90 degrees from the vertical.
<h5>2.1.9 Berms</h5>
All berms are "off limits" to all persons at all times, except when access to them is specifically permitted by a Range Officer (see Section 10.6).
<h5>2.1.3  (Handgun | PCC only)</h5>
Whenever metal targets or metal hard cover are used in a course of fire, precautions must be taken so that competitors and Match Officials maintain a minimum distance of 7 meters from them while they are being shot. Where possible, this should be done with physical barriers. If Fault Lines are used to limit the approach to metal targets, they must be placed at least 8 meters from the targets so that the competitor may inadvertently fault the line and still be outside the 7 meter minimum distance (see Rule 10.4.7). Care should also be taken in respect of metal props in the line of fire.
<h5>2.1.3  (Shotgun only)</h5>
Whenever metal targets or metal hard cover are used in a course of fire, minimum distances apply while they are being shot. Where possible, this should be done with physical barriers. If Fault Lines are used to limit the approach to metal targets, they must be placed further away so that the competitor may inadvertently fault the line and still be outside the minimum distance (see Rule 10.4.7). Care should also be taken in respect of metal props in the line of fire.
<h6>2.1.3.1  (Shotgun only)</h6>
The minimum distance is 5 meters. Fault Lines must be placed at least 6 meters from the targets or metal hard cover.
<h6>2.1.3.2  (Shotgun only)</h6>
The minimum distance is 40 meters. Fault Lines must be placed at least 41 meters from the targets or metal hard cover.
<h5>2.1.10  (Shotgun only)</h5>
Some types of slug ammunition have detachable wads and in buckshot cartridges the wads separate from the pellets. In view of this paper targets should either be "backed" (e.g. with plywood or another product of a suitable thickness), or placed at a greater distance. 10 meters is recommended in the case of buckshot, to prevent such wads penetrating paper targets.
<h5>2.1.11  (Shotgun only)</h5>
A competitor must never be required to engage paper targets using birdshot ammunition.
<h5>2.1.12  (Shotgun only)</h5>
Courses of fire must nominate a single permitted type of ammunition, i.e. birdshot, buckshot or slugs.
<h5>2.1.3  (Rifle only)</h5>
Whenever metal targets or metal hard cover are used in a course of fire, precautions must be taken so that competitors and Match Officials maintain a minimum distance of 50 meters from them while they are being shot. Where possible, this should be done with physical barriers. If Fault Lines are used to limit the approach to metal targets, they must be placed at least 51 meters from the targets so that the competitor may inadvertently fault the line and still be outside the 50 meter minimum distance (see Rule 10.4.7). Care should also be taken in respect of metal props in the line of fire.
<h5>2.1.3  (MiniRifle only)</h5>
Whenever metal targets or metal hard cover are used in a course of fire, precautions must be taken so that competitors and Match Officials maintain a minimum distance of 5 meters from them while they are being shot. Where possible, this should be done with physical barriers. If Fault Lines are used to limit the approach to metal targets, they must be placed at least 6 meters from the targets so that the competitor may inadvertently fault the line and still be outside the 5 meter minimum distance (see Rule 10.4.7). Care should also be taken in respect of metal props in the line of fire.
