<h1>2.2 Course Construction Criteria</h1>
During the construction of a course of fire, a variety of physical barriers may be used to restrict competitor movement and to provide additional competitive challenges as follows: 
<h5>2.2.1 Fault Lines</h5>
Competitor movement should preferably be restricted through the use of physical barriers. However, the use of Fault Lines is permitted as follows:
<h6>2.2.1.1 </h6>
To prevent unsafe and/or unrealistic charging at, or retreat from, targets;
<h6>2.2.1.2 </h6>
To simulate the use of physical barriers and/or cover;
<h6>2.2.1.3 </h6>
To define the boundaries of a general shooting area or part thereof.
<h6>2.2.1.4 </h6>
Fault Lines must be fixed firmly in place, they must rise at least 2 centimeters above ground level, they should be constructed of wood or other rigid materials, and they should be of a consistent color (preferably red), at every COF in a match. Unless used in a continuous manner to define the boundary of a general shooting area, fault lines must be a minimum of 1.5 meters in length, but they are deemed to extend to infinity (also see Rule 4.4.1).
<h6>2.2.1.5 </h6>
If a COF has a passageway visibly delineated by fault lines and/or a clearly demarcated shooting area, any competitor who takes a shortcut by stepping on the ground outside the passageway and/or shooting area will incur one procedural penalty for each shot fired after beginning the shortcut.
<h5>2.2.2  (ActionAir only)</h5>
Courses of fire may include the use of major obstacles to be surmounted by competitors. Obstacles used in this way must not exceed a height of 2 meters. Obstacles over 1 meter in height must be supplied with scaling aids to assist competitors and must be constructed to provide for the competitor-s safety in the following ways:
<h6>2.2.2.1  (ActionAir only)</h6>
Obstacles must be firmly anchored and braced to provide adequate support when in use. Wherever possible, unduly sharp or rough surfaces must be removed to reduce the possibility of injury to competitors and/or Match Officials.
<h6>2.2.2.2  (ActionAir only)</h6>
The descending side of any obstacle must be clear of obstructions or natural hazards.
<h6>2.2.2.3  (ActionAir only)</h6>
Competitors must be permitted to test such obstacles before making their attempt at the course of fire.
<h6>2.2.2.4  (ActionAir only)</h6>
Competitors must not be required to holster their handgun before ascending these obstacles.
<h5>2.2.3 Barriers</h5>
Must be constructed in the following manner:
<h6>2.2.3.1 </h6>
They must be high enough and strong enough to serve the intended purpose. Unless supplemented by a shooting platform or similar, barriers of at least 1.8 meters high are deemed to extend skywards to infinity (also see Rule 10.2.11).
<h6>2.2.3.2 </h6>
They should include Fault Lines projecting rearward at ground level from the side edges.
<h5>2.2.4  (ActionAir | Handgun only)</h5>
A tunnel that a competitor is required to enter or pass through must be constructed of suitable material and to any length. However, sufficient ports must be provided to allow Match Officials to safely monitor competitor action. Tunnel mouth edges must be prepared to minimize the possibility of injury to competitors and Match Officials. Course Designers must clearly designate the entrance and exit portions of the tunnel as well as the parameters for shooting at any targets from within the tunnel (e.g. Fault Lines). Also see Rule 10.5.4.
<h5>2.2.5  (ActionAir | Handgun only)</h5>
Are tunnels comprised of braced uprights supporting loose overhead materials (e.g. wooden slats), which may fall off when inadvertently dislodged by competitors (see Rule 10.2.5). These tunnels may be constructed to any height, but overhead materials must not be heavy enough to cause injury if they fall. Also see Rule 10.5.4.
<h5>2.2.6 Stage Props</h5>
Where these items are intended to support a competitor in motion or while shooting targets, they must be constructed with the safety of the competitor and Match Officials as a priority. Provisions must be made to allow Match Officials to safely monitor and control competitor action at all times. Props must be strong enough to withstand use by all competitors.
<h5>2.2.7 Windows and Ports</h5>
Must be placed at a height reachable by most competitors, with a sturdy platform being available for use by others, if requested, without penalty.
<h5>2.2.2  (Handgun only)</h5>
Courses of fire may include the use of major obstacles to be surmounted by competitors. Obstacles used in this way must not exceed a height of 2 meters. Obstacles over 1 meter in height must be supplied with scaling aids to assist competitors and must be constructed to provide for the competitor's safety in the following ways:
<h6>2.2.2.1  (Handgun only)</h6>
Obstacles must be firmly anchored and braced to provide adequate support when in use. Wherever possible, unduly sharp or rough surfaces must be removed to reduce the possibility of injury to competitors and/or Match Officials.
<h6>2.2.2.2  (Handgun only)</h6>
The descending side of any obstacle must be clear of obstructions or natural hazards.
<h6>2.2.2.3  (Handgun only)</h6>
Competitors must be permitted to test such obstacles before making their attempt at the course of fire.
<h6>2.2.2.4  (Handgun only)</h6>
Competitors must not be required to holster their handgun before ascending these obstacles.
<h5>2.2.2  (Shotgun | Shotgun | Rifle | Rifle | MiniRifle | MiniRifle | PCCPCC only)</h5>
Not applicable.
<h5>2.2.5  (Shotgun | Rifle | MiniRifle | PCC only)</h5>
Are tunnels comprised of braced uprights supporting loose overhead materials (e.g. wooden slats), which may fall off when inadvertently dislodged by competitors (see Rule 10.2.5). These tunnels may be constructed to any height, but overhead materials must not be heavy enough to cause injury if they fall.
