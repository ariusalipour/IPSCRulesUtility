<h1>4.6 Range Equipment Failure and Other Issues</h1>

<h5>4.6.1  (ActionAir only)</h5>
Range equipment must present the challenge fairly and equitably to all competitors. Range equipment failure includes, but is not limited to, the displacement of paper targets, the premature activation of rigid or moving targets, the malfunction of mechanically or electrically operated equipment, and the failure of props such as openings, ports, and barriers.
<h6>4.6.1.1  (ActionAir only)</h6>
The declaration and/or use of any firearm as range equipment is prohibited.
<h5>4.6.2  (ActionAir only)</h5>
A competitor who is unable to complete a course of fire due to range equipment failure, or if a rigid or moving target was not reset prior to his attempt at a course of fire, must be required to reshoot the course of fire after corrective actions have been taken.
<h6>4.6.2.1  (ActionAir only)</h6>
Unrestored paper targets are not range equipment failure (see Rule 9.1.4).
<h6>4.6.2.2  (ActionAir only)</h6>
If a Range Master deems that one or more targets in a course of fire are faulty and/or have been presented in a manner significantly different to earlier presentations, he may offer a reshoot to the affected competitor(s).
<h5>4.6.3 </h5>
Chronic malfunction of equipment in a course of fire may result in the removal of that stage from the match results (see Rule 2.3.4).
