<h1>4.4 Frangible and Synthetic Targets (Handgun | Shotgun only)</h1>

<h5>4.4.1  (Handgun only)</h5>
Frangible targets, such as clay pigeons or tiles, are not authorized targets for IPSC Handgun matches.
<h5>4.4.2  (Handgun | Shotgun only)</h5>
Synthetic targets (e.g. "self-sealing" targets etc.), sometimes used by indoor ranges, must not be used at Level III or higher matches. However, subject to the prior written approval of a Regional Director, synthetic targets may be used at Level I and II matches held within his Region.
<h5>4.4.1  (Shotgun only)</h5>
Frangible targets, such as clay pigeons or tiles, may be used as scoring targets, but not as no-shoots, in IPSC Shotgun matches.
