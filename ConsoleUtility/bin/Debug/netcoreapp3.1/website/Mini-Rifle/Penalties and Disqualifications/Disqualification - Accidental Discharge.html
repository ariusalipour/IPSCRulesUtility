<h1>10.4 Disqualification - Accidental Discharge</h1>

<h5>10.4.1 </h5>
A shot, which travels over a backstop, a berm or in any other direction, specified in the written stage briefing by the match organizers as being unsafe. Note that a competitor who legitimately fires a shot at a target, which then travels in an unsafe direction, will not be disqualified, but the provisions of Section 2.3 may apply.
<h5>10.4.2 </h5>
A shot which strikes the ground within 3 meters of the competitor, except when shooting at a paper or frangible target closer than 3 meters to the competitor. A shot which strikes the ground within 3 meters of the competitor due to a "squib" load is exempt from this rule.
<h5>10.4.3 </h5>
A shot which occurs while actually loading, reloading or unloading a firearm. This includes any shot fired during the procedures outlined in Rules 8.3.1 and 8.3.7 (also see Rule 10.5.9).
<h6>10.4.3.1 Exception</h6>
a detonation, which occurs while unloading a firearm, is not considered a shot or discharge subject to a disqualification. However, Rule 5.1.6 may apply.
<h5>10.4.4 </h5>
A shot which occurs during remedial action in the case of a malfunction.
<h5>10.4.5 </h5>
A shot which occurs while transferring a rifle between hands.
<h5>10.4.6 </h5>
A shot which occurs during movement, except while actually shooting at targets.
<h5>10.4.7 </h5>
A shot fired at a metal target from a distance of less than 5 meters, measured from the front of the target to the nearest part of the competitor's body in contact with the ground (see Rule 2.1.3).
<h5>10.4.8 </h5>
In this Section, if it can be established that the cause of the discharge is due to a broken or defective part of the firearm, the competitor has not committed any safety infraction in this Section, and a disqualification will not be invoked, but the competitor's scores for that stage will be zero.
<h6>10.4.8.1 </h6>
The firearm must be immediately presented for inspection to the Range Master or his delegate, who will inspect the firearm and carry out any tests necessary to establish that a broken or defective part caused the discharge. A competitor may not later appeal a disqualification for an accidental discharge due to a broken or defective part if they fail to present the firearm for inspection prior to leaving the course of fire.
