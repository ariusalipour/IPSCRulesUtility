<h1>10.3 Disqualification - General Regulations</h1>

<h5>10.3.1 </h5>
A competitor who commits a safety infraction or any other prohibited activity during an IPSC match will be disqualified, and will be prohibited from attempting any remaining courses of fire regardless of the schedule or physical layout of the match, pending the verdict of any appeal submitted in accordance with Chapter 11 of these rules.
<h5>10.3.2 </h5>
When a disqualification is issued, the Range Officer must record the reasons for the disqualification, and the time and date of the incident, on the competitor's score sheet, and the Range Master must be notified as soon as possible.
<h5>10.3.3 </h5>
Scores for a competitor who has received a disqualification must not be deleted from match results, and match results must not be declared final by the Match Director, until the time limit prescribed in Rule 11.3.1 has passed, provided no appeal to arbitration on any matter has been submitted to the Range Master (or his delegate).
<h5>10.3.4 </h5>
If an appeal to arbitration is submitted within the time limit prescribed in Rule 11.3.1, the provisions of Rule 11.3.2 will prevail.
<h5>10.3.5 </h5>
Scores for a competitor who has completed a pre-match or main match without a disqualification will not be affected by a disqualification received while that competitor is participating in a Shoot-Off or other side match (also see Rule 6.2.4).
