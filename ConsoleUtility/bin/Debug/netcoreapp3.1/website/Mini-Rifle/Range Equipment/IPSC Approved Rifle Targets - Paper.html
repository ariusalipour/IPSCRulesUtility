<h1>4.2 IPSC Approved Rifle Targets - Paper</h1>

<h5>4.2.1 </h5>
There are four paper targets approved for use in IPSC Mini Rifle matches (see Appendix B).
<h5>4.2.2 </h5>
Paper targets must have scoring lines and 0.5 cm (Mini and Micro Targets 0.3 cm) non-scoring borders clearly marked on the front of the target. However, scoring lines and non-scoring borders should not be visible beyond a distance of 10 meters.
<h6>4.2.2.1 </h6>
The front of paper no-shoots must include a sufficiently distinguishable non-scoring border. In the absence of perforations or other suitable markings, the Range Master must ensure that all affected no-shoots have a replacement 0.5 cm (Mini and Micro Targets 0.3 cm) non-scoring border drawn or fitted thereon.
<h5>4.2.3 </h5>
When the scoring area of a paper target is to be partially hidden, Course Designers must simulate hard cover in one of the following ways:
<h6>4.2.3.1 </h6>
By actually hiding a portion of the target (see Rule 4.1.4.1); or
<h6>4.2.3.2 </h6>
By physically cutting targets from edge to edge to remove the portion deemed to be hidden by hard cover. Such targets must be fitted with a replacement 0.5 cm (Mini and Micro Targets 0.3 cm) non-scoring border, which must extend the full width of the edge of the cut scoring area (see Rule 4.2.2); or
<h6>4.2.3.3 </h6>
By painting or taping with a sharply defined boundary the portion of the target deemed to be hidden by hard cover with a single and visibly contrasting color.
<h6>4.2.3.4 </h6>
When paper targets are partially hidden, physically cut, painted and/or taped, at least a portion of all scoring zones must remain visible.
<h5>4.2.4 </h5>
Hard cover (and overlapping no-shoots) must not completely hide the A zone on a partially hidden paper target.
