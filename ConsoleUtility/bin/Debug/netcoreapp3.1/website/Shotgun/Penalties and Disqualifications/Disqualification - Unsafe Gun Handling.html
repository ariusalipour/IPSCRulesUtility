<h1>10.5 Disqualification - Unsafe Gun Handling</h1>
Examples of unsafe gun handling include, but are not limited to: 
<h5>10.5.1 </h5>
Handling a shotgun at any time except when in a designated Safety Area, or elsewhere deemed safe by a Range Officer, or when under the supervision of, and in response to a direct command issued by, a Range Officer may invoke a disqualification. This does not apply to the carrying of shotguns where Rule 5.2.1 will apply. Violation of Rule 5.2.1 may invoke a disqualification.
<h5>10.5.2 </h5>
Allowing the muzzle of a firearm to point uprange, or past the default, or specific safe angles of fire during a course of fire. Exception: when fitting the chamber safety flag in compliance with Rule 8.3.7.2 the muzzle may point uprange within a radius of 50 cm from a competitor-s feet.
<h5>10.5.3 </h5>
If at any time during the course of fire, a competitor drops his firearm or causes it to fall, loaded or not. Note that a competitor who, for any reason during a course of fire, safely and intentionally places the firearm on the ground or other stable object will not be disqualified provided:
<h6>10.5.3.1 </h6>
The competitor maintains constant physical contact with the firearm, until it is placed firmly and securely on the ground or another stable object; and
<h6>10.5.3.2 </h6>
The competitor remains within 1 meter of the firearm at all times (except where the firearm is placed at a greater distance, under the supervision of a Range Officer, in order to comply with a start position); and
<h6>10.5.3.3 </h6>
The provisions of Rule 10.5.2 do not occur; and
<h6>10.5.3.4 </h6>
The firearm is in the ready condition as specified in Section 8.1; or
<h6>10.5.3.5 </h6>
The firearm is unloaded and the action is open.
<h5>10.5.4 </h5>
Not applicable.
<h5>10.5.5 </h5>
Allowing the muzzle of a shotgun to point at any part of the competitor's body during a course of fire (i.e. sweeping).
<h5>10.5.6 </h5>
Not applicable.
<h5>10.5.7 </h5>
Using more than one firearm during a course of fire.
<h5>10.5.8 </h5>
Failure to keep the finger outside the trigger guard while clearing a malfunction where the competitor clearly moves the firearm away from aiming at targets.
<h5>10.5.9 </h5>
Failure to keep the finger outside the trigger guard during loading, reloading, or unloading. A competitor will be exempt from this rule when operating the trigger to release the action and/or drop the hammer while making ready prior to the Start Signal. In the event that the gun discharges during this operation Rule 10.4.3 will still apply.
<h5>10.5.10 </h5>
Failure to keep the finger outside the trigger guard during movement in accordance with Rule 8.5.1.
<h5>10.5.11 </h5>
Not applicable.
<h5>10.5.12 </h5>
Handling live or dummy ammunition in a Safety Area, contrary to Rule 2.4.4.
<h6>10.5.12.1 </h6>
The word "handling" does not preclude competitors from entering a Safety Area with live or dummy ammunition in their pockets, on their belt or in their range bag, provided the competitor does not physically remove the loose or packaged ammunition from their belt, pockets or range bag while within the Safety Area.
<h5>10.5.13 </h5>
Having a loaded firearm other than when specifically authorized by a Range Officer.
<h5>10.5.14 </h5>
Retrieving a dropped firearm. Dropped firearms must always be retrieved by a Range Officer who will, after checking and/or clearing the firearm, return it to the competitor in a safe condition. Dropping an unloaded firearm or causing it to fall outside of a course of fire is not an infraction. However, a competitor who retrieves a dropped firearm will receive a disqualification.
<h5>10.5.15 </h5>
Using prohibited and/or unsafe ammunition (see Rules 5.5.4 and 5.5.6 to 5.5.6.4), and/or using a prohibited firearm (see Rules 5.1.10 and 5.1.11).
