<h1>5.6 Chronograph and Power Factors</h1>

<h5>5.6.1 </h5>
The power factors for each Division are stipulated in Appendix D. The cartridge power factor is usually calculated by reference to the manufacturer-s published data. However, one or more official match chronographs may be used to assist in the determination of power factor. In the absence of manufacturer-s published data and chronographs, the power factor declared by a competitor cannot be challenged.
<h6>5.6.1.1 </h6>
Ammunition tested must be of the same type i.e. birdshot or buckshot or slug, and configuration (see Rule 5.5.7), and not mixed for testing purposes. All ammunition used by a competitor in a match must be capable of satisfying the minimum power factor. Match Officials may call for tests of a competitor's ammunition at any point during the match.
<h6>5.6.1.2 </h6>
It is not considered necessary to routinely test every competitor-s ammunition. Instead, random tests may be carried out at the discretion of the Match Officials.
<h6>5.6.1.3 </h6>
A competitor who has been asked to present his shotgun for testing may be required to submit to the test immediately and without any alterations being made to the shotgun prior to or during the test, including changing chokes and/or cleaning. The only exception being in the case of a malfunction.
<h5>5.6.2 </h5>
The chronograph must be properly set up in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and verified each day by Match Officials in the following manner:
<h6>5.6.2.1 </h6>
At the beginning of the first day of the match, a Range Officer will fire 3 rounds from the supply of the official match calibration ammunition through the calibration firearm over the chronograph, and the average velocity of the 3 rounds will be recorded;
<h6>5.6.2.2 </h6>
On each of the following match days, the process will be repeated using the same firearm and ammunition supply (ideally from the same factory lot);
<h6>5.6.2.3 </h6>
The chronograph will be deemed to be within tolerance if the daily average velocity is within +/-5% of the average velocity achieved in Rule 5.6.2.1;
<h6>5.6.2.4 </h6>
Should a daily variance exceed the allowable tolerance stated above, the Range Master will take whatever steps he deems necessary to rectify the situation. A sample form suitable for recording daily readings appears in Appendix C4;
<h6>5.6.2.5 </h6>
The official match bullet scale(s) should be initially calibrated, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, when the first squad arrives for testing each day and again immediately before each subsequent squad is tested (see Rule 5.6.3);
<h5>5.6.3 </h5>
Competitor Ammunition Testing Procedure
<h6>5.6.3.1 </h6>
Ammunition must be tested using the competitor's firearm.
<h6>5.6.3.2 </h6>
An initial 8 sample rounds for the chronograph test will be drawn from the competitor at a time and place determined by Match Officials, who may require additional tests of a competitor-s ammunition at any time during the match.
<h6>5.6.3.3 </h6>
From the 8 sample rounds drawn by Match Officials, the projectile(s) (the slug or shot) of 1 cartridge is (are) weighed to determine the actual weight of the projectile(s), and 3 rounds are fired over the chronograph. All digits visible on the scales and chronograph displays must be used at face value (i.e. without rounding or truncation), for the calculation in Rule 5.6.3.5. Wads are not to be included in the weight calculation except in the case of wads that are fixed to the back of slugs and that are designed to continue to the target as part of the slug. In the absence of scales, the competitor's declared weight of the projectile(s) will be used.
<h6>5.6.3.4 </h6>
If projectile(s) weighing is conducted in advance of a competitor's arrival, weighed projectile(s) must be retained by the chronograph station with the competitor-s remaining sample rounds, until the competitor or their delegate has attended the chronograph station and completed testing. If a competitor challenges the weight of a projectile(s) pre-weighed before his arrival, he is entitled to have the scales calibrated, and the test projectile(s) reweighed, in his presence.
<h6>5.6.3.5 </h6>
Power factor is calculated using the actual weight of the projectile(s) and the average velocity of the 3 rounds fired, according to the following formula:
<h6>5.6.3.6 </h6>
If the resultant power factor fails to meet the minimum power factor floor, another 3 rounds will be fired over the chronograph. The power factor will be recalculated using the weight of the projectile(s) and the average velocity of the 3 highest velocity rounds from the 6 rounds fired.
<h6>5.6.3.7 </h6>
If the power factor is still insufficient, the competitor may elect to have his final round:
<h6>5.6.3.8 </h6>
Not applicable.
<h6>5.6.3.9 </h6>
If the resultant power factor fails to meet the minimum power factor floor for the relevant Division, the competitor may continue shooting the match, but his scores will not be entered into match results nor count for match recognition and awards.
<h6>5.6.3.10 </h6>
Not applicable.
<h6>5.6.3.11 </h6>
The scores of a competitor who, for any reason, fails to present his firearm for testing at the designated time and location and/or who fails to provide sample rounds for testing whenever requested by a Match Official, will be removed from the match results.
<h6>5.6.3.12 </h6>
If the Range Master deems that a chronograph has become inoperative, and further testing of competitor-s ammunition is not possible, the power factors of competitors which have been successfully tested will stand, and for all other competitors it will be accepted that they have achieved the minimum power factor without challenge, subject to any applicable Division requirements (see Appendix D).
