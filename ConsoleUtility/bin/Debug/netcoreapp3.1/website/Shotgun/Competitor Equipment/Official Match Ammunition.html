<h1>5.8 Official Match Ammunition</h1>

<h5>5.8.1 </h5>
When match organizers make official match ammunition available for purchase by competitors at a match, the Match Director must, both in advance in official match literature (and/or on the official match website), and by way of a sign certified by him and posted at a conspicuous place at the point of sale, clearly identify the: manufacturer, brand(s), calibers, cartridge case lengths, shot size, shot weight, velocity, powder dram equivalent (if available).

Official match ammunition must be approved by the Regional Director of the Region in which the match is being held (and by the IPSC President in respect of Level IV or higher matches).

<h5>5.8.2 </h5>
