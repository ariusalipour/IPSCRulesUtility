<h1>9.10 Official Time</h1>

<h5>9.10.1 </h5>
Only the timing device operated by a Range Officer must be used to record the official elapsed time of a competitor's attempt at a course of fire. If a Range Officer assigned to a course of fire (or a more senior Match Official) deems that a timing device is faulty, a competitor whose attempt cannot be credited with an accurate time will be required to reshoot the course of fire.
<h5>9.10.2 </h5>
If, in the opinion of an Arbitration Committee, the time credited to a competitor for a course of fire is deemed to be unrealistic, the competitor will be required to reshoot the course of fire (see Rule 9.7.4).
