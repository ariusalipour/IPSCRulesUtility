<h1>9.5 Target Scoring Policy</h1>

<h5>9.5.1 </h5>
Scoring paper targets must be engaged with a minimum of one round each. In the case of slug ammunition 1 or 2 hits can be nominated to score (the default is 1 hit). In the case of buckshot ammunition the best two hits count for score i.e. the two highest scoring strikes of any pellets from any buckshot rounds fired.
<h6>9.5.1.1 </h6>
If two or more targets receive direct scoring hits as a result of a single shot they will both, or all, be scored normally unless Rule 9.1.5 applies (also see Rule 9.5.6).
<h5>9.5.2 </h5>
If the diameter of a hit from a slug or a buckshot pellet on a scoring paper target touches the scoring line between two scoring areas, or the line between the non-scoring border and a scoring area, or if it crosses multiple scoring areas, it will be scored the higher value.
<h5>9.5.3 </h5>
If the diameter of a hit from a slug or a buckshot pellet touches the scoring area of overlapping scoring paper targets and/or paper no-shoots, it will earn all applicable scores and penalties.
<h5>9.5.4 </h5>
Radial tears radiating outwards from the diameter of a slug or a buckshot pellet hole will not count for score or penalty.
<h6>9.5.4.1 </h6>
Enlarged holes in paper targets which exceed the diameter of a slug or a buckshot pellet, as the case may be, will not count for score or penalty unless there is visible evidence within the remnants of the hole (e.g. a grease mark, striations or a "crown" etc.), to eliminate a presumption that the hole was caused by a ricochet or splatter.
<h5>9.5.5 </h5>
The minimum score for a stage will be zero.
<h5>9.5.6 </h5>
A competitor who fails to engage the front of each scoring target in a course of fire with at least one round will incur one procedural penalty per target for failure to engage the target, as well as appropriate penalties for misses (see Rule 10.2.7).
<h6>9.5.6.1 </h6>
A competitor will not incur failure to engage penalties where two or more targets receive scoring hits as a result of a single shot (see Rule 9.5.1.1). If a competitor fires less shots at a target array than the number of targets in that array, and one or more target(s) does/do not receive scoring hits then failure to engage penalties and misses will apply as appropriate.
<h5>9.5.7 </h5>
Hits visible on a scoring paper target or no-shoot, which are the result of shots fired through the rear of that or another scoring paper target or no-shoot, and/or hits which fail to create a clearly distinguishable hole through the front of a scoring paper target or no-shoot, will not count for score or penalty, as the case may be.
<h5>9.5.8 </h5>
Frangible targets must be fully penetrated or break with a piece separated from the original target to be counted for score.
<h5>9.5.9 </h5>
If a wad has caused an extra hole in a paper target and it cannot be determined which hole has been caused by the actual slug, the competitor must reshoot the stage.
<h5>9.5.10 </h5>
If a wad from a buckshot cartridge has caused a hole in a paper target there must be no assumption that any missing hit has passed through the hole unless there is visible evidence around the edge of the hole of a hit
<h5>9.5.11 </h5>
If a competitor uses ammunition contrary to the type specified for a course of fire the following will apply:
<h6>9.5.11.1 </h6>
If the course of fire is restricted to a specific ammunition type for safety reasons then the competitor may be subject to a disqualification (see Rules 10.4.9 and 10.4.10).
<h6>9.5.11.2 </h6>
For a paper target hits will not be counted for score and the target will be treated as a missed target. However, competitors are permitted to reengage the target with the correct ammunition type for score.
<h6>9.5.11.3 </h6>
Metal targets and metal no-shoots will be scored normally but the competitor will be subject to procedural penalties (see Rule 10.2.12).
