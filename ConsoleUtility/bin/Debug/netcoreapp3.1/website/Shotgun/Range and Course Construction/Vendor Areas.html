<h1>2.6 Vendor Areas</h1>

<h5>2.6.1 </h5>
Vendors (i.e. individuals, corporations and other entities displaying or selling merchandise at an IPSC match) are solely responsible for the safe handling and security of their products and other items in their care, and ensuring they are displayed in a condition that will not endanger any person. Assembled firearms must be deactivated prior to being displayed.
<h5>2.6.2 </h5>
The Range Master (in consultation with the Match Director) must clearly delineate the vendor area, and he may issue "Acceptable Practice Guidelines" to all vendors, who are responsible for their implementation in respect of their own merchandise.
<h5>2.6.3 </h5>
Competitors may handle unloaded vendor's firearms while remaining wholly within the vendor areas, provided reasonable care is taken to ensure that the muzzle is not pointed at any person while being handled.
