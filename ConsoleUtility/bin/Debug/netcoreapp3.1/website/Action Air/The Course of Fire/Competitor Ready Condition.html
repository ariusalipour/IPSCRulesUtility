<h1>8.2 Competitor Ready Condition</h1>

<h5>8.2.1 </h5>
The handgun is prepared as specified in the written stage briefing, and is in compliance with the requirements of the relevant Division.
<h5>8.2.2 </h5>
The competitor assumes the start position as specified in the written stage briefing. Unless otherwise specified, the competitor must stand erect, facing downrange, with the handgun loaded and holstered, and arms hanging naturally by the sides (see Appendix E2). A competitor who attempts or completes a course of fire where an incorrect start position was used may be required by a Range Officer to reshoot the course of fire.
<h5>8.2.3 </h5>
A course of fire must never require or allow a competitor to touch or hold a handgun, loading device or projectile after the "Standby" command and before the Start Signal (except for unavoidable touching with the lower arms).
<h5>8.2.4 </h5>
A course of fire must never require the competitor to draw a handgun from the holster with the weak hand.
<h5>8.2.5 </h5>
A course of fire must never require the competitor to re-holster a handgun after the Start Signal. However, a competitor may re-holster provided this is accomplished safely, and the handgun is either unloaded or in a ready condition stated in Section 8.1. Violations will be subject to disqualification (see Rule 10.5.11).
