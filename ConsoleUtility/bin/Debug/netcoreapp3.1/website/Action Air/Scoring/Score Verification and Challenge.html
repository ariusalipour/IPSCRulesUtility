<h1>9.6 Score Verification and Challenge</h1>

<h5>9.6.1 </h5>
After the Range Officer has declared "Range is Clear", the competitor or their delegate will be permitted to accompany the official responsible for scoring to verify the scoring.
<h5>9.6.2 </h5>
The Range Officer responsible for a course of fire may stipulate that the scoring process will begin while a competitor is actually completing a course of fire. In such cases, the competitor-s delegate is entitled to accompany the official responsible for scoring in order to verify the scoring. Competitors must be advised of this procedure during the squad briefing.
<h5>9.6.3 </h5>
A competitor (or his delegate) who fails to verify a target during the scoring process loses all right of appeal in respect of scoring that target.
<h5>9.6.4 </h5>
Any challenge to a score or penalty must be appealed to the Range Officer by the competitor (or his delegate) prior to the subject target being painted, patched, or reset, failing which such challenges will not be accepted.
<h5>9.6.5 </h5>
In the event that the Range Officer upholds the original score or penalty and the competitor is dissatisfied, he may appeal to the Chief Range Officer and then to the Range Master for a ruling.
<h5>9.6.6 </h5>
The Range Master-s ruling in respect of the scoring of hits on targets and no-shoots will be final. No further appeals are permitted with respect to such scoring decisions.
<h5>9.6.7 </h5>
During a scoring challenge, the subject target(s) must not be patched, taped or otherwise interfered with until the matter has been settled, failing which Rule 9.1.3 will apply. The Range Officer may remove a disputed paper target from the course of fire for further examination to prevent any delay in the match. Both the competitor and the Range Officer must sign the target and clearly indicate which hit(s) is (are) subject to challenge.
<h5>9.6.8 </h5>
Scoring overlays approved by the Range Master must be used exclusively, as and when required, to verify and/or determine the applicable scoring zone of hits on paper targets.
<h5>9.6.9 </h5>
Scoring information may be relayed through the use of hand signals (see Appendix F1). If a score is challenged, the subject targets must not be restored until they have been verified by the competitor or his delegate, in accordance with whatever arrangements have been approved in advance by the Range Master (also see Rule 9.1.3).
