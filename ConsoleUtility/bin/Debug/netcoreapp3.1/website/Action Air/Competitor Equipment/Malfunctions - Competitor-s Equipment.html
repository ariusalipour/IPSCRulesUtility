<h1>5.7 Malfunctions - Competitor-s Equipment</h1>

<h5>5.7.1 </h5>
If a competitor's firearm malfunctions after the Start Signal, the competitor may safely attempt to correct the problem and continue the course of fire. During such corrective action, the competitor must keep the muzzle of the firearm pointing safely downrange at all times. The competitor must not use rods or other tools to verify or correct the malfunction. Violations will result in a zero score for the stage.
<h6>5.7.1.1 </h6>
A competitor who experiences a firearm malfunction while responding to the "Load And Make Ready" or "Make Ready" command, but prior to issuance of the Start Signal, is entitled to retire, under the authority and supervision of the Range Officer, to repair his firearm, without penalty, subject to the provisions of Rule 5.7.4, Rule 8.3.1.1 and all other safety rules. Once the repairs have been completed (and the provisions of Rule 5.1.7 have been satisfied, if applicable), the competitor may return to attempt the course of fire, subject to scheduling as determined by the Range Officer or Range Master.
<h5>5.7.2 </h5>
While rectifying a malfunction that requires the competitor to clearly move the firearm away from aiming at a target, the competitor's fingers must be clearly visible outside the trigger guard (see Rule 10.5.8).
<h5>5.7.3 </h5>
In the event that a firearm malfunction cannot be corrected by the competitor within 2 minutes, or if the competitor self-stops for any other reason, he must point the firearm safely downrange and advise the Range Officer, who will terminate the course of fire in the normal manner. The course of fire will be scored as shot including all applicable misses and penalties. However, if a Stop Plate is being used, the affected competitor will receive a zero score for the subject stage.
<h5>5.7.4 </h5>
Under no circumstances is a competitor permitted to leave a course of fire in the possession of a loaded firearm (see Rule 10.5.13).
<h5>5.7.5 </h5>
Where the firearm has failed as above, the competitor must not be permitted to reshoot the course of fire. This includes instances where a firearm is declared unserviceable or unsafe during a course of fire (see Rule 5.1.6).
<h5>5.7.6 </h5>
In the event that a Range Officer terminates a course of fire due to a suspicion that a competitor has an unsafe firearm or unsafe projectiles, the Range Officer will take whatever steps he deems necessary to return both the competitor and the range to a safe condition. The Range Officer will then inspect the firearm or projectiles and proceed as follows:
<h6>5.7.6.1 </h6>
If the Range Officer finds evidence that confirms the suspected problem, the competitor will not be entitled to a reshoot, but will be ordered to rectify the problem. On the competitor's score sheet, the time will be recorded up to the last shot fired, and the course of fire will be scored "as shot", including all applicable misses and penalties (see Rule 9.5.6). However, if a Stop Plate is being used, the affected competitor will receive a zero score for the subject stage.
<h6>5.7.6.2 </h6>
If the Range Officer discovers that the suspected safety problem does not exist, the competitor will be required to reshoot the stage.
