<h1>3.2 Written Stage Briefings</h1>

<h5>3.2.1 </h5>
A written stage briefing consistent with these rules and approved by the Range Master must be posted at each course of fire prior to commencement of the match. This briefing will take precedence over any course of fire information published or otherwise communicated to competitors in advance of the match, and it must provide the following minimum information: - Targets (type & number); - Number of projectiles to be scored; - The handgun ready condition; - Start position; - Time starts: audible or visual signal; - Time stops: last shot and/or Stop Plate; - Location of Stop Plate (if used); - Procedure.
<h5>3.2.2 </h5>
The Range Officer in charge of a course of fire must read out the written stage briefing verbatim to each squad. The Range Officer must visually demonstrate the acceptable Start Position (either by use of a picture or physically) at all match levels.
<h5>3.2.3 </h5>
The Range Master may modify a written stage briefing at any time for reasons of clarity, consistency or safety (see Section 2.3).
<h5>3.2.4 </h5>
After the written stage briefing has been read to competitors, and questions arising therefrom have been answered, competitors should be permitted to conduct an orderly inspection ("walkthrough") of the course of fire. The duration of time for the inspection must be stipulated by the Range Officer, and it should be the same for all competitors. If the course of fire includes moving targets or similar items, these should be demonstrated to all competitors for the same duration and frequency.
