<h1>6.6 Competitor Scheduling and Squadding</h1>

<h5>6.6.1 </h5>
Competitors must compete for score according to the published match and squadding schedule. A competitor who is not present at the scheduled time and date for any stage may not attempt that stage without the prior approval of the Match Director, failing which the competitor's score for that stage will be zero.
<h5>6.6.2 </h5>
Only Match Officials (approved by the Range Master), match sponsors, IPSC Patrons and dignitaries (approved by the Match Director), who are members in good standing of their Region of residence, and IPSC Officers (as defined in Section 6.1 of the IPSC Constitution) may compete in a pre-match. Scores attained in the pre-match will be included in the overall match results provided dates of the pre-match are published in advance in the official match schedule. Competitors in the main match must not be restricted from viewing the pre-match.
<h5>6.6.3 </h5>
A match, tournament or league will be deemed to have started on the first day that competitors (including those specified above) shoot for score and will be deemed to have ended when the results have been declared final by the Match Director.
