<h1>4.3 IPSC Approved Pistol Caliber Carbine Targets - Metal</h1>

<h5>4.3.1 </h5>
General Rules
<h6>4.3.1.1 </h6>
Metal targets and no-shoots which can accidentally turn edge-on or sideways when hit are expressly prohibited. Using them may result in withdrawal of IPSC sanction.
<h6>4.3.1.2 </h6>
Metal targets and no-shoots which a Range Officer deems have fallen or overturned due to being hit on the apparatus supporting them, or for any other accidental reason (e.g. wind action, a ricochet, being hit solely by a shotgun wad etc.), will be treated as range equipment failure (see Rule 4.6.1).
<h6>4.3.1.3 </h6>
Metal targets and no-shoots do not have a non-scoring border.
<h6>4.3.1.4 </h6>
Metal targets and no-shoots must be shot and fall, overturn or self-indicate to score.
<h5>4.3.2 </h5>
IPSC Poppers
<h6>4.3.2.1 </h6>
IPSC Poppers and IPSC Mini Poppers are both approved metal targets designed to recognize power, and must be calibrated as specified in Appendix C1.
<h5>4.3.3 </h5>
IPSC Plates
<h6>4.3.3.1 </h6>
Metal plates of various sizes may be used (see Appendix C3).
<h6>4.3.3.2 </h6>
Metal plates do not recognize power and are not subject to calibration or calibration challenges. If a metal plate has been adequately and directly hit (i.e. with a full bullet diameter) but it fails to fall or overturn, a Range Officer may declare range equipment failure and order the competitor to reshoot the course of fire, after the faulty plate has been rectified.
<h6>4.3.3.3 </h6>
Metal plates which fail to fall or overturn when initially hit, but which fall or overturn when hit with a subsequent shot, are not subject to a reshoot.
<h6>4.3.3.4 </h6>
Metal plates must not be used exclusively in a course of fire. At least one authorized scoring paper target or scoring popper (in addition to any paper or metal no-shoots), must be included in each course of fire.
<h5>4.3.4 </h5>
No-Shoots
<h6>4.3.4.1 </h6>
Metal no-shoot poppers and plates may be designed to fall or overturn when hit, or may be designed to remain upright. In either case, they must, if hit, be repainted during the scoring process, failing which subsequent competitors must not be penalized for hits visible on their surface.
<h6>4.3.4.2 </h6>
Metal no-shoots in the general size and shape of authorized paper targets may be used.
