<h1>10.5 Disqualification - Unsafe Gun Handling</h1>

<h5>10.5.1 </h5>
Handling a firearm at any time except when in a designated Safety Area or when under the supervision of, and in response to a direct command issued by, a Range Officer.
<h5>10.5.2 </h5>
Allowing the muzzle of a firearm to point uprange, or past the default, or specific safe angles of fire during a course of fire, (limited exceptions: see Rules 2.1.2.1, 5.2.7.3 and 10.5.6).
<h5>10.5.3 </h5>
If at any time during the course of fire, a competitor drops his firearm or causes it to fall, loaded or not. Note that a competitor who, for any reason during a course of fire, safely and intentionally places the firearm on the ground or other stable object will not be disqualified provided:
<h6>10.5.3.1 </h6>
The competitor maintains constant physical contact with the firearm, until it is placed firmly and securely on the ground or another stable object; and
<h6>10.5.3.2 </h6>
The competitor remains within 1 meter of the firearm at all times (except where the firearm is placed at a greater distance, under the supervision of a Range Officer, in order to comply with a start position); and
<h6>10.5.3.3 </h6>
The provisions of Rule 10.5.2 do not occur; and
<h6>10.5.3.4 </h6>
The firearm is in the ready condition as specified in Section 8.1; or
<h6>10.5.3.5 </h6>
The firearm is unloaded and the action is open.
<h5>10.5.4 </h5>
Drawing or holstering a handgun within the confines of a tunnel.
<h5>10.5.5 </h5>
Allowing the muzzle of a handgun to point at any part of the competitor's body during a course of fire (i.e. sweeping). A disqualification is not applicable if sweeping occurs while drawing or re-holstering a gun, or while taking action under Rule 8.3.6.1, provided the competitor's fingers are clearly outside the trigger guard.
<h5>10.5.6 </h5>
Allowing the muzzle of a loaded handgun to point rearwards uprange beyond a radius of 1 meter from a competitor's feet during drawing or re-holstering. The 1 meter concession only applies when a competitor is facing directly downrange.
<h5>10.5.7 </h5>
Wearing or using more than one firearm during a course of fire.
<h5>10.5.8 </h5>
Failure to keep the finger outside the trigger guard while clearing a malfunction where the competitor clearly moves the firearm away from aiming at targets.
<h5>10.5.9 </h5>
Failure to keep the finger outside the trigger guard during loading, reloading, or unloading except where specifically permitted (see Rules 8.1.2.5, 8.3.7.1 and 8.7.1).
<h5>10.5.10 </h5>
Failure to keep the finger outside the trigger guard during movement in accordance with Rule 8.5.1.
<h5>10.5.11 </h5>
Having a loaded and holstered handgun, in any of the following conditions:
<h6>10.5.11.1 </h6>
A single action self-loading pistol with the chamber loaded and the safety not applied.
<h6>10.5.11.2 </h6>
A double action or selective action pistol with the hammer cocked and the safety not applied.
<h5>10.5.12 </h5>
Handling projectiles, or anything containing propellant gas, in a Safety Area, contrary to Rule 2.4.4.
<h6>10.5.12.1 </h6>
The word "handling" does not preclude competitors from entering a Safety Area with projectiles or propellant gas in magazines or speed loaders or propellant gas containers on their belt, in their pockets or in their range bag, provided the competitor does not physically remove the loaded/charged magazines, speed loaders or propellant gas containers from their retaining or storage device while within the Safety Area.

<h5>10.5.14 </h5>
Retrieving a dropped firearm. Dropped firearms must always be retrieved by a Range Officer who will, after checking and/or clearing the firearm, place it directly into the competitor's gun case, gun bag or holster. Dropping an unloaded firearm or causing it to fall outside of a course of fire is not an infraction. However, a competitor who retrieves a dropped firearm will receive a disqualification.
<h5>10.5.15 </h5>
Using prohibited and/or unsafe projectiles (see Rules 5.5.4, 5.5.6 and 5.6.1), and/or using firearm (see Rules 5.1.10 and 5.1.11).  a  prohibited
