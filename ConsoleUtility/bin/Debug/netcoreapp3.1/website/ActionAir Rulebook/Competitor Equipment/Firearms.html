<h1>5.1 Firearms</h1>

<h5>5.1.1 </h5>
Firearms are regulated by Divisions (see Appendix D), but courses of fire must remain consistent for all Divisions.
<h5>5.1.2 </h5>
Approved Action Air Handguns are those which fire projectiles of 6 mm diameter (also see Rule 5.5.4). Self-loading pistols must have a magazine containing the projectiles and propellant in a single, detachable unit, they must have a retractable slide, and they must operate with a blowback action.
<h5>5.1.3 </h5>
Sights
<h6>5.1.3.1 </h6>
"Open sights" are aiming devices fitted to a firearm which do not use electronic circuitry and/or lenses. Fiber-optic inserts are deemed not to be lenses.
<h6>5.1.3.2 </h6>
"Optical/electronic sights" are aiming devices (including flashlights) fitted to a firearm which use electronic circuitry and/or lenses.
<h6>5.1.3.3 </h6>
The Range Master is the final authority in respect of the classification of any sights used in an IPSC match and/or their compliance with these rules, including the Divisions in Appendix D.
<h5>5.1.4 </h5>
Unless required by a Division (see Appendix D), there is no restriction on the trigger pull weight of a firearm, but the trigger mechanism must, at all times, function safely.
<h5>5.1.5 </h5>
Triggers and/or trigger shoes that extend beyond the width of the trigger guard are expressly prohibited.
<h5>5.1.6 </h5>
Firearms must be serviceable and safe. Range Officers may demand examination of a competitor-s firearm or allied equipment, at any time, to check they are functioning safely. If any such item is declared unserviceable or unsafe by a Range Officer, it must be withdrawn from the match until the item is repaired to the satisfaction of the Range Master (also see Rule 5.7.5).
<h5>5.1.7 </h5>
Competitors must use the same firearm and type of sights for all courses of fire in a match. However, in the event that a competitor-s original firearm and/or sights become unserviceable or unsafe during a match, the competitor must, before using a substitute firearm and/or sights, seek permission from the Range Master who may approve the substitution provided he is satisfied:
<h6>5.1.7.1 </h6>
The substitute firearm satisfies the requirements of the relevant Division; and
<h6>5.1.7.2 </h6>
In using the substitute firearm the competitor will not gain an advantage.
<h5>5.1.8 </h5>
A competitor who substitutes or significantly modifies a firearm and/or sights during a match without the prior approval of the Range Master will be subject to the provisions of Rule 10.6.1.
<h5>5.1.9 </h5>
A competitor must never use or wear on his person more than one firearm during a course of fire (see Rule 10.5.7).
<h5>5.1.10 </h5>
Handguns with shoulder stocks and/or fore grips of any kind are prohibited (see Rule 10.5.15).
<h5>5.1.11 </h5>
Handguns offering "burst" and/or fully automatic operation (i.e. whereby more than one projectile can be discharged on a single pull or activation of the trigger) are prohibited (see Rule 10.5.15).
<h5>5.1.12 </h5>
Handguns with more than one barrel are prohibited.
