<h1>4.1 Targets - General Principles</h1>

<h5>4.1.1 </h5>
Only targets approved by the IPSC Assembly and which fully comply with the specifications in Appendices B and C, and frangible targets (see Rule 4.4.1), are to be used for IPSC Pistol Caliber Carbine matches.
<h6>4.1.1.1 </h6>
If one or more targets at a match fail to comply exactly with the stated specifications, and if replacement targets of the correct specifications are unavailable, the Range Master must decide whether or not the variance is acceptable for that match, and which provisions of Section 2.3 of these rules will apply, if any. However, the Range Master's decision will only affect the match in progress, and will not serve as a precedent for future matches held at the same location, or for any subsequent use of the subject targets at another match.
<h6>4.1.1.2 </h6>
There are two sizes of paper targets and poppers approved for use in IPSC matches (see Appendices B and C). IPSC Mini Targets and Mini Poppers are used to simulate IPSC Targets and Poppers placed at greater distances. The following types and sizes of targets may be included together in the same target array:
<h5>4.1.2 </h5>
Scoring targets used in all IPSC matches must be of a single color, as follows:
<h6>4.1.2.1 </h6>
The scoring area of the IPSC Target and Mini Target must be tan colored, except where the Range Master deems that a lack of contrast with the surrounding area or background necessitates that a different color be used.
<h6>4.1.2.2 </h6>
The entire front of scoring metal or other non-paper targets must be painted a single color, preferably white.
<h5>4.1.3 </h5>
No-shoots must be clearly marked with a conspicuous "X" or be of a single, unique color different from scoring targets throughout a match or tournament. Paper and metal no-shoots may be of different colors in a match or tournament provided that the chosen color is consistent for all no-shoots of the same material (i.e. if metal no-shoots are yellow, they must all be yellow and if paper no-shoots are white, they must all be white in a match or tournament).
<h5>4.1.4 </h5>
Targets used in a course of fire may be partially or wholly hidden through the use of hard or soft cover, as follows:
<h6>4.1.4.1 </h6>
Cover provided to hide all or a portion of a target will be considered hard cover. When possible hard cover should not be simulated but constructed using impenetrable materials (see Rule 2.1.3). Whole paper targets must not be used solely as hard cover.
<h6>4.1.4.2 </h6>
Cover provided merely to obscure targets is considered soft cover. Shots which have passed through soft cover and which strike a scoring target will score. Shots that have passed through soft cover before hitting a no-shoot will be penalized. All scoring zones on targets obscured by soft cover must be left wholly intact. Targets obscured by soft cover must either be visible through the soft cover or at least a portion of the affected target(s) must be visible from around the soft cover.
<h5>4.1.5 </h5>
Declaring a single, intact target to represent two or more targets by use of tape, paint or any other means and/or attaching a Mini Target to a full size target is prohibited.
<h5>4.1.6 </h5>
Only IPSC targets, and mechanically or electrically operated devices, can be used to activate moving targets.
