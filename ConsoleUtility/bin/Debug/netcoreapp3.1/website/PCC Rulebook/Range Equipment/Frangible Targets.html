<h1>4.4 Frangible Targets</h1>

<h5>4.4.1 </h5>
Frangible targets, such as tiles, may be used as scoring targets, but not as no-shoots, in IPSC Pistol Caliber Carbine matches. Clay pigeons are not authorized targets for IPSC Pistol Caliber Carbine matches.
<h5>4.4.2 </h5>
Synthetic targets (e.g. "self-sealing" targets etc.), sometimes used by indoor ranges, must not be used at Level III or higher matches. However, subject to the prior written approval of a Regional Director, synthetic targets may be used at Level I and II matches held within his Region.
