<h1>2.2 Course Construction Criteria</h1>

<h5>2.2.1 Fault Lines</h5>
Competitor movement should preferably be restricted through the use of physical barriers. However, the use of Fault Lines is permitted as follows:
<h6>2.2.1.1 </h6>
To prevent unsafe and/or unrealistic charging at, or retreat from, targets;
<h6>2.2.1.2 </h6>
To simulate the use of physical barriers and/or cover;
<h6>2.2.1.3 </h6>
To define the boundaries of a general shooting area or part thereof.
<h6>2.2.1.4 </h6>
Fault Lines must be fixed firmly in place, they must rise at least 2 centimeters above ground level, they should be constructed of wood or other rigid materials, and they should be of a consistent color (preferably red), at every COF in a match. Unless used in a continuous manner to define the boundary of a general shooting area, fault lines must be a minimum of 1.5 meters in length, but they are deemed to extend to infinity (also see Rule 4.4.1).
<h6>2.2.1.5 </h6>
If a COF has a passageway visibly delineated by fault lines and/or a clearly demarcated shooting area, any competitor who takes a shortcut by stepping on the ground outside the passageway and/or shooting area will incur one procedural penalty for each shot fired after beginning the shortcut.
<h5>2.2.2 </h5>
Not applicable.
<h5>2.2.3 Barriers</h5>
Must be constructed in the following manner:
<h6>2.2.3.1 </h6>
They must be high enough and strong enough to serve the intended purpose. Unless supplemented by a shooting platform or similar, barriers of at least 1.8 meters high are deemed to extend skywards to infinity (also see Rule 10.2.11).
<h6>2.2.3.2 </h6>
They should include Fault Lines projecting rearward at ground level from the side edges.
<h5>2.2.4 </h5>
Not applicable.
<h5>2.2.5 Cooper Tunnels</h5>
Are tunnels comprised of braced uprights supporting loose overhead materials (e.g. wooden slats), which may fall off when inadvertently dislodged by competitors (see Rule 10.2.5). These tunnels may be constructed to any height, but overhead materials must not be heavy enough to cause injury if they fall.
<h5>2.2.6 Stage Props</h5>
Where these items are intended to support a competitor in motion or while shooting targets, they must be constructed with the safety of the competitor and Match Officials as a priority. Provisions must be made to allow Match Officials to safely monitor and control competitor action at all times. Props must be strong enough to withstand use by all competitors.
<h5>2.2.7 Windows and Ports</h5>
Must be placed at a height reachable by most competitors, with a sturdy platform being available for use by others, if requested, without penalty.
