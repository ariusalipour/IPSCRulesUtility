<h1>9.2 Scoring Method</h1>

<h5>9.2.1 </h5>
"Comstock" - Unlimited time stops on the last shot as recorded by the timer and/or Stop Plate, unlimited number of shots to be fired, stipulated number of hits per target to count for score.
<h6>9.2.1.1 </h6>
A competitor's score is calculated by adding the highest value stipulated number of hits per target, minus penalties, divided by the total time (recorded to two decimal places) taken by the competitor to complete the course of fire, to arrive at a hit factor. The overall stage results are factored by awarding the competitor with the highest hit factor the maximum points available for the course of fire, with all other competitors ranked relatively below the stage winner.
<h5>9.2.2 </h5>
Stage results must rank competitors within the relevant Division in descending order of individual stage points achieved, calculated to 4 decimal places.
<h5>9.2.3 </h5>
