<h1>9.5 Target Scoring Policy</h1>

<h5>9.5.1 </h5>
Unless otherwise specified in the written stage briefing, scoring paper targets must be shot with a minimum of one projectile each, with the best two hits to score. Scoring rigid targets must be shot with a minimum of one projectile each and must fall to score.
<h5>9.5.2 </h5>
If the projectile diameter of a hit on a scoring target touches the scoring line between two scoring areas, or the line between the non-scoring border and a scoring area, or if it crosses multiple scoring areas, it will be scored the higher value.
<h5>9.5.3 </h5>
If a projectile diameter touches the scoring area of overlapping scoring targets and/or no-shoots, it will earn all applicable scores and penalties.
<h5>9.5.4 </h5>
Radial tears radiating outwards from the diameter of a projectile hole will not count for score or penalty.
<h6>9.5.4.1 </h6>
Enlarged holes in paper targets which exceed the competitor's projectile diameter will not count for score or penalty unless there is visible evidence within the remnants of the hole to eliminate a presumption that the hole was caused by a ricochet or splatter.
<h5>9.5.5 </h5>
The minimum score for a stage will be zero.
<h5>9.5.6 </h5>
A competitor who fails to engage the front of each scoring target in a course of fire with at least one projectile will incur one procedural penalty per target for failure to engage the target, as well as appropriate penalties for misses (see Rule 10.2.7).
<h5>9.5.7 </h5>
Hits visible on a scoring paper target or no-shoot, which are the result of shots fired through the rear of that or another scoring paper target or no-shoot, and/or hits which fail to create a clearly distinguishable hole through the front of a scoring paper target or no-shoot, will not count for score or penalty, as the case may be.
