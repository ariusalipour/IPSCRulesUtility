<h1>4.3 IPSC Approved Action Air Targets - Rigid</h1>

<h5>4.3.1 </h5>
General Rules
<h6>4.3.1.1 </h6>
Rigid targets and no-shoots which can accidentally turn edge-on or sideways when hit are expressly prohibited. Using them may result in withdrawal of IPSC sanction.
<h6>4.3.1.2 </h6>
Rigid targets and no-shoots which a Range Officer deems have fallen or overturned due to being hit on the apparatus supporting them, or for any other accidental reason (e.g. wind action, a ricochet, etc.), will be treated as range equipment failure (see Rule 4.6.1).
<h6>4.3.1.3 </h6>
Rigid targets and no-shoots do not have a non-scoring border.
<h6>4.3.1.4 </h6>
Rigid targets and no-shoots must be shot and fall, overturn or self-indicate to score.
<h5>4.3.2 </h5>
IPSC Action Air Poppers
<h6>4.3.2.1 </h6>
IPSC Action Air Poppers and IPSC Action Air Mini Poppers are both approved rigid targets designed to recognize power, and must be calibrated as specified in Appendix C1.
<h5>4.3.3 </h5>
IPSC Action Air Plates
<h6>4.3.3.1 Stop Plates</h6>
For the sake of consistent time recording of the end of a competitor-s attempt at a COF, the use of a Stop Plate, complying with the specifications in Appendix C3, is recommended. Stop Plates must be clearly distinguishable from regular plates and they are subject to sensitivity calibration (see Appendix C1). Stop Plates are non-scoring.
<h6>4.3.3.2 Stop Plates</h6>
Stop Plates do not recognize power and, with the exception of sensitivity calibration, are not subject to calibration or calibration challenges. If a Stop Plate has been adequately and directly hit (i.e. with a full projectile diameter) but it fails to self-indicate, a Range Officer may declare range equipment failure and order the competitor to reshoot the course of fire, after the faulty Stop Plate has been rectified.
<h6>4.3.3.3 Stop Plates</h6>
Stop Plates which fail to self-indicate when initially hit, but which self-indicate when hit with a subsequent shot, are not subject to a reshoot.
<h6>4.3.3.4 Falling Plates</h6>
Falling plates, not less than 10 centimeters square or in diameter, may be used (see Appendix C3).
<h6>4.3.3.5 Falling Plates</h6>
Falling plates do not recognize power and are not subject to calibration or calibration challenges.
<h6>4.3.3.6 Falling Plates</h6>
Falling plates must not be used exclusively in a course of fire. At least one authorized scoring paper target or scoring popper (in addition to any paper or rigid no-shoots), must be included in each course of fire.
<h5>4.3.4 </h5>
No-Shoots
<h6>4.3.4.1 </h6>
Rigid no-shoot poppers and plates must be designed to fall, overturn or self-indicate when hit.
<h6>4.3.4.2 </h6>
Rigid no-shoots in the general size and shape of authorized paper targets may be used.
