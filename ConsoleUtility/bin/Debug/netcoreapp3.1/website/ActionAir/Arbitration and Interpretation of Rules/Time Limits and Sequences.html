<h1>11.3 Time Limits and Sequences</h1>

<h5>11.3.1 </h5>
Time Limit for Appeal to Arbitration - Written appeals to arbitration must be submitted to the Range Master on the appropriate form, accompanied by the applicable fee, within one hour of the time of the disputed call as recorded by Match Officials. Failure to comply will render the appeal invalid, and no further action will be taken. The Range Master must, on the appeal form, immediately record the time and date he received the appeal.
<h5>11.3.2 </h5>
Decision Time Limit - The Committee must reach a decision within 24 hours of the request for arbitration or before the results have been declared final by the Match Director, whichever comes first. If the Committee fails to render a decision within the prescribed period, both a first and third party appellant (see Rule 11.7.1) will automatically succeed in their appeal, and the fee will be returned.
