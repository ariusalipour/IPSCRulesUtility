<h1>8.7 Sight Pictures, Dry Firing and Course Inspection</h1>

<h5>8.7.1 </h5>
Competitors are prohibited from taking a sight picture with a loaded firearm prior to the Start Signal. Violation will result in a warning for the first occurrence and one procedural penalty for each subsequent occurrence in the same match.
<h6>8.7.1.1 </h6>
If match organizers also prohibit taking a sight picture with an unloaded firearm prior to the Start Signal, competitors must be advised in the written stage briefing. Violation will result in a warning for the first occurrence and one procedural penalty for each subsequent occurrence in the same match.
<h6>8.7.1.2 </h6>
When permitted, competitors taking a sight picture with an unloaded firearm prior to the Start Signal must only do so on a single target, to verify that their sights are prepared as required. Competitors who test a targeting sequence or a shooting position while taking a sight picture will incur one procedural penalty per occurrence.
<h5>8.7.2 </h5>
Competitors are prohibited from using any sighting aid (e.g. the whole or part of an imitation or replica firearm, any part of a real firearm including any accessories thereof etc.), except for their own hands, while conducting their inspection ("walkthrough") of a course of fire. Violations will incur one procedural penalty per occurrence (also see Rule 10.5.1).
<h5>8.7.3 </h5>
No person is permitted to enter or move through a course of fire without the prior approval of a Range Officer assigned to that course of fire, or the Range Master. Violations will incur a warning for the first offense but may be subject to the provisions of Section 10.6 for subsequent offenses.
