<h1>1.1 General Principles</h1>

<h5>1.1.1 Safety</h5>
IPSC matches must be designed, constructed and conducted with due consideration to safety.
<h5>1.1.2 Quality</h5>
The value of an IPSC match is determined by the quality of the challenge presented in the course design. Courses of fire must be designed primarily to test a competitor-s IPSC shooting skills, not their physical abilities.
<h5>1.1.3 Balance</h5>
Accuracy, Power and Speed are equivalent elements of IPSC shooting, and are expressed in the Latin words "Diligentia, Vis, Celeritas" ("DVC"). A properly balanced course of fire will depend largely upon the nature of the challenges presented therein. However, courses must be designed, and IPSC matches must be conducted in such a way, as to evaluate these elements equally.
<h5>1.1.4 Diversity</h5>
IPSC shooting challenges are diverse. While it is not necessary to construct new courses for each match, no single course of fire must be repeated to allow its use to be considered a definitive measure of IPSC shooting skills.
<h5>1.1.5 Freestyle</h5>
IPSC matches are freestyle. Competitors must be permitted to solve the challenge presented in a freestyle manner and, for handgun and shotgun matches, to shoot targets on an "as and when visible" basis. After the Start Signal, courses of fire must not require mandatory reloads nor dictate a shooting position, location or stance, except as specified below. However, conditions may be created, and barriers or other physical limitations may be constructed, to compel a competitor into shooting positions, locations or stances.
<h6>1.1.5.1 </h6>
Level I and Level II matches are not required to comply strictly with the freestyle requirements or round count limitations (see Section 1.2).
<h6>1.1.5.2 </h6>
Short Courses and Classifiers may include mandatory reloads and may dictate a shooting position, location and/or stance. When a mandatory reload is required, it must be completed after the competitor shoots at his first target, and before he shoots at his final target. Violations are subject to one procedural penalty.
<h6>1.1.5.3 </h6>
General Courses and Classifiers may not specify that the weak shoulder is to be used when shooting.
<h6>1.1.5.4 </h6>
If a written stage briefing specifies that a competitor is required to carry, retain or grasp an object during his attempt at a course of fire, Rule 10.2.2 will apply.
<h6>1.1.5.5 </h6>
Course Designers may give competitors freedom to await the Start Signal anywhere within the boundaries of a well demarcated firing zone.
<h5>1.1.6 Difficulty</h5>
IPSC matches present varied degrees of difficulty. No shooting challenge may be appealed as being prohibitive. This does not apply to non-shooting challenges, which should reasonably allow for differences in competitor's height and physical build.
<h5>1.1.7 Challenge</h5>
IPSC matches recognize the challenges presented when using full power firearms in dynamic shooting, and must always employ a minimum power factor to be attained by all competitors to reflect this challenge.
