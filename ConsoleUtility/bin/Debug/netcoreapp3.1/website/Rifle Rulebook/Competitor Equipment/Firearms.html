<h1>5.1 Firearms</h1>

<h5>5.1.1 </h5>
Firearms are regulated by Divisions (see Appendix D), but courses of fire must remain consistent for all Divisions.
<h5>5.1.2 </h5>
There is no minimum caliber for rifles used in IPSC matches.
<h5>5.1.3 </h5>
Sights
<h6>5.1.3.1 </h6>
"Open sights" are aiming devices fitted to a firearm which do not use electronic circuitry and/or lenses. Fiber-optic inserts are deemed not to be lenses.
<h6>5.1.3.2 </h6>
"Optical/electronic sights" are aiming devices (including flashlights) fitted to a firearm which use electronic circuitry and/or lenses.
<h6>5.1.3.3 </h6>
The Range Master is the final authority in respect of the classification of any sights used in an IPSC match and/or their compliance with these rules, including the Divisions in Appendix D.
<h5>5.1.4 </h5>
Unless required by a Division (see Appendix D), there is no restriction on the trigger pull weight of a firearm, but the trigger mechanism must, at all times, function safely.
<h5>5.1.5 </h5>
Triggers and/or trigger shoes that extend beyond the width of the trigger guard are expressly prohibited. However, rifles fitted with "winter triggers/guards" may be used in this mode, provided that this fitting was designed, manufactured and provided as part of the rifle and only when the particular climate or weather conditions dictate their use.
<h5>5.1.6 </h5>
Firearms must be serviceable and safe. Range Officers may demand examination of a competitor-s firearm or allied equipment, at any time, to check they are functioning safely. If any such item is declared unserviceable or unsafe by a Range Officer, it must be withdrawn from the match until the item is repaired to the satisfaction of the Range Master (also see Rule 5.7.5).
<h5>5.1.7 </h5>
Competitors must use the same firearm and type of sights for all courses of fire in a match. However, in the event that a competitor-s original firearm and/or sights become unserviceable or unsafe during a match, the competitor must, before using a substitute firearm and/or sights, seek permission from the Range Master who may approve the substitution provided he is satisfied:
<h6>5.1.7.1 </h6>
The substitute firearm satisfies the requirements of the relevant Division and is of the same type, action and caliber and is fitted with the same type of sights; and
<h6>5.1.7.2 </h6>
In using the substitute firearm the competitor will not gain an advantage; and
<h6>5.1.7.3 </h6>
The competitor-s ammunition, when tested in the substitute firearm, attains the minimum power factor.
<h5>5.1.8 </h5>
A competitor who substitutes or significantly modifies a firearm and/or sights during a match without the prior approval of the Range Master will be subject to the provisions of Rule 10.6.1.
<h6>5.1.8.1 </h6>
The mounting or detaching of a magwell, barricade stop or vertical front grip is not considered a significant modification of a firearm.
<h5>5.1.9 </h5>
A competitor must never use or wear on his person more than one firearm during a course of fire (see Rule 10.5.7).
<h5>5.1.10 </h5>
The rifle must be fitted with a stock enabling it to be fired from the shoulder (see Rule 10.5.15).
<h5>5.1.11 </h5>
Rifles offering only "burst" and/or fully automatic operation (i.e. whereby more than one round can be discharged on a single pull or activation of the trigger) are prohibited (see Rule 10.5.15).
<h5>5.1.12 </h5>
Combination guns offering an additional barrel, or barrels, that is not a conventional rifle barrel (e.g. a rifle and shotgun combination), are prohibited.
