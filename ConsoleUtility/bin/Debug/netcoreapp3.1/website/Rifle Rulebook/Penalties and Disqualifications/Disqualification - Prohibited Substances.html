<h1>10.7 Disqualification - Prohibited Substances</h1>

<h5>10.7.1 </h5>
All persons are required to be in complete control both mentally and physically during IPSC matches.
<h5>10.7.2 </h5>
IPSC considers the abuse of alcoholic products, non-prescription and non-essential drugs and the use of illegal or performance enhancing drugs, irrespective of how they are taken or administered, to be an extremely serious offense.
<h5>10.7.3 </h5>
Except when used for medicinal purposes, competitors and officials at matches must not be affected by drugs (including alcohol) of any sort during matches. Any person, who in the opinion of the Range Master is visibly under the influence of any of the items described herein, will be disqualified from the match and may be required to leave the range.
<h5>10.7.4 </h5>
IPSC reserves the right to prohibit any general or specific substances and to introduce tests for the presence of these substances at any time (see separate IPSC Anti-Doping Rules).
