<h1>7.3 Appointment of Officials</h1>

<h5>7.3.1 </h5>
Match organizers must, prior to commencement of a match, appoint a Match Director and a Range Master to carry out the duties detailed in these rules. The nominated Range Master should preferably be the most competent and experienced certified Match Official present (also see Rule 7.1.5). For Level I and II matches a single person may be appointed to be both the Match Director and the Range Master.
<h5>7.3.2 </h5>
References in these rules to Match Officials (e.g. "Range Officer", "Range Master" etc.), mean personnel who have been officially appointed by match organizers to actually serve in an official capacity at the match. Persons who are certified Match Officials, but who are actually participating in the match as regular competitors, have no standing or authority as Match Officials for that match. Such persons should therefore not participate in the match wearing garments bearing Match Official insignia.
<h5>7.3.3 </h5>
A person acting as a Match Official is prohibited from having a holstered firearm while directly accompanying and timing a competitor during his attempt at a COF. Violations are subject to Rule 7.2.2.
