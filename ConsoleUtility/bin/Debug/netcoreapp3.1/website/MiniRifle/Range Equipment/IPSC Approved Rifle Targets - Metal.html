<h1>4.3 IPSC Approved Rifle Targets - Metal</h1>

<h5>4.3.1 </h5>
General Rules
<h6>4.3.1.1 </h6>
Metal targets and no-shoots which can accidentally turn edge-on or sideways when hit are expressly prohibited. Using them may result in withdrawal of IPSC sanction.
<h6>4.3.1.2 </h6>
Metal targets and no-shoots which a Range Officer deems have fallen or overturned due to being hit on the apparatus supporting them, or for any other accidental reason (e.g. wind action, a ricochet, etc.), will be treated as range equipment failure (see Rule 4.6.1).
<h6>4.3.1.3 </h6>
Metal targets and no-shoots do not have a non-scoring border.
<h6>4.3.1.4 </h6>
Metal targets and no-shoots must be shot and fall, overturn or self-indicate to score.
<h5>4.3.2 </h5>
IPSC Poppers
<h6>4.3.2.1 </h6>
IPSC Poppers and IPSC Mini Poppers are both approved metal targets designed to recognize power, and must be calibrated as specified in Appendix C1.

IPSC Plates
<h6>4.3.3.1 </h6>
Metal plates of various sizes may be used (see Appendix C3). Metal targets in the general size and shape of authorized paper targets may also be used.

Metal plates do not recognize power and are not subject to calibration or calibration challenges. If a metal plate has been adequately and directly hit (i.e. with a full bullet diameter) but it fails to fall or overturn, a Range Officer may declare range equipment failure and order the competitor to reshoot the course of fire, after the faulty plate has been rectified.
