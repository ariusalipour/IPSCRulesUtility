<h1>1.2 Types of Courses</h1>
IPSC matches may contain the following types of courses of fire: 
<h5>1.2.1 </h5>
General Courses of Fire:
<h6>1.2.1.1 Short Courses</h6>
Must not require more than 10 rounds to complete.
<h6>1.2.1.2 Medium Courses</h6>
Must not require more than 20 rounds to complete. Course design and construction must not require more than 5 scoring targets to be shot from any single location or view, nor allow a competitor to shoot all targets in the course of fire from any single location or view.
<h6>1.2.1.3 Long Courses</h6>
Must not require more than 40 rounds to complete. Course design and construction must not require more than 5 scoring targets to be shot from any single location or view, nor allow a competitor to shoot all targets in the course of fire from any single location or view.
<h6>1.2.1.4 </h6>
The approved balance for an IPSC sanctioned match is a ratio of 3 Short Courses to 2 Medium Courses to 1 Long Course (see Approved Stage Ratios in Appendix A4).
<h6>1.2.1.5 </h6>
Option 2 and/or Option 3 rifle ready conditions (see Chapter 8), should not be required for more than 25% of the courses of fire in a match.
<h6>1.2.1.6 </h6>
The recommended balance for an IPSC Mini Rifle match with regards to target distance is: 30% of all targets to be less than 25 meters, 50% to be between 25 and 40 meters and 20% to be between 40 and 120 meters.
<h6>1.2.1.7 </h6>
Where the physical dimensions of a range preclude the siting of targets at distances greater than 50 meters, it is recommended that the IPSC Micro Target be used (see Appendix B5).
<h5>1.2.2 </h5>
Special Courses of Fire:
<h6>1.2.2.1 Classifiers</h6>
Courses of fire authorized by a Regional Director and/or IPSC, which are available to competitors seeking a regional and/or international classification. Classifiers must be set up in accordance with these rules and be conducted strictly in accordance with the notes and diagrams accompanying them. Results must be submitted to the authorizing entity in the format required (with the applicable fees, if any), in order for them to be recognized.
<h6>1.2.2.2 </h6>
Shoot-Off - An event conducted separately from a match. Two eligible competitors simultaneously engage two identical and adjacent target arrays in a process of one or more elimination bouts (see Appendix A3). It is recommended that metal targets be used, and that the final target for each competitor is set so that it overlaps that of the other competitor when struck down, with the winner being the competitor whose target is on the bottom. Each target array must not exceed 12 rounds and each competitor may be required to perform a mandatory reload after shooting at his first target, and before he shoots at his final target. Violations are subject to automatic forfeiture of the bout.
