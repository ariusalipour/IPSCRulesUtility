<h1>1.3 IPSC Sanctioning</h1>

<h5>1.3.1 </h5>
Match organizers wishing to receive IPSC sanctioning must comply with the general principles of course design and course construction as well as all other current IPSC Rules and regulations relevant to the discipline. Courses of fire that do not comply with these requirements will not be sanctioned, and must not be publicized or announced as IPSC sanctioned matches.
<h5>1.3.2 </h5>
Target arrays and presentations or props included in courses of fire submitted to IPSC, but deemed by IPSC to be illogical or impractical, will not be approved (see latest version of the separate Target Array Book).
<h5>1.3.3 </h5>
The IPSC President, his delegate, or an officer of the Confederation (in that order), may withdraw IPSC sanctioning from a match if, in his or their opinion, a match or any component part thereof:
<h6>1.3.3.1 </h6>
Contravenes the purpose or spirit of the principles of course design; or
<h6>1.3.3.2 </h6>
Has been constructed at significant variance to the sanctioned design; or
<h6>1.3.3.3 </h6>
Is in breach of any current IPSC Rules; or
<h6>1.3.3.4 </h6>
Is likely to bring the sport of IPSC shooting into disrepute; or
<h6>1.3.3.5 </h6>
If the provisions of Rule 6.5.1.1 have not been observed.
<h5>1.3.4 </h5>
IPSC match level requirements and recommendations are specified in Appendix A1.
