<h1>9.3 Scoring Ties</h1>

<h5>9.3.1 </h5>
If, in the opinion of the Match Director, a tie in match results must be broken, the affected competitors must shoot one or more courses of fire, nominated or created by the Match Director, until the tie is broken. The result of a tiebreaker will only be used to determine the final placing of the affected competitors, and their original match points will remain unchanged. Ties must never be broken by chance.
