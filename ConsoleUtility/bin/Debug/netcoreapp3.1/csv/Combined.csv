Each target array must not exceed 12 rounds and each competitor may be required to perform a mandatory reload after shooting at his first target~ and before he shoots at his final target. Violations are subject to automatic forfeiture of the bout.,70348304-1cc1-409a-8b7f-672008342781,00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
