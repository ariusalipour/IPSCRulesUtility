Competitors must be permitted to solve the challenge presented in a freestyle manner and~ for handgun and shotgun matches~ to shoot targets on an "as and when visible" basis. After the Start Signal~ courses of fire must not require mandatory reloads nor dictate a shooting position~ location or stance~ except as specified below. However~ conditions may be created~ and barriers or other physical limitations may be constructed~ to compel a competitor into shooting positions~ locations or stances.,a5978786-0990-4f3e-881c-9667a935701a,3f52c074-f577-40b1-b940-fcaf3a8bf9cd
