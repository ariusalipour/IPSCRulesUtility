Each competitor must be permitted to solve the competitive problem in his own way and must not be hindered by being forced to act in any manner which might cause unsafe action. Targets must be arranged so that shooting at them as presented will not cause competitors to breach safe angles of fire.,38e62820-194e-40e4-836a-63a33e3ed7ce,b11983a0-562e-4cbe-93f2-c0a5663bb3ca
