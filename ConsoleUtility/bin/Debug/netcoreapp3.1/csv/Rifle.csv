RULE,3bf6cd83-5abe-4399-9e95-9a7b6137fb6b,Quality,1.1.2,The value of an IPSC match is determined by the quality of the challenge presented in the course design.

After the Start Signal~ courses of fire must not require mandatory reloads nor dictate a shooting position~ location or stance~ except as specified below. However~ conditions may be created~ and barriers or other physical limitations may be constructed~ to compel a competitor into shooting positions~ locations or stances.,69e331d5-8de5-414c-a779-b3b5bd2acdf6,d947064a-0c40-4756-ad3a-39c0cd1b6f73
