RULE,5d42eeb6-9452-48ff-acaf-b35a31036b9f,Quality,1.1.2,The value of an IPSC match is determined by the quality of the challenge presented in the course design.

After the Start Signal~ courses of fire must not require mandatory reloads nor dictate a shooting position~ location or stance~ except as specified below. However~ conditions may be created~ and barriers or other physical limitations may be constructed~ to compel a competitor into shooting positions~ locations or stances.,3e0c3d0f-f6e1-421d-95a3-95ad332e899f,7a20e947-7670-43ca-a276-d3c346378fb8
