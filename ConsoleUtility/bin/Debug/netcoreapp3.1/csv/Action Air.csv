RULE,ee933141-605b-4aae-81f6-4102679dc9fc,Quality,1.1.2,The value of an IPSC match is determined by the quality of the challenge presented in the course design.

RULE,99eb05be-70de-41af-bcba-1c4165771c6c,Balance,1.1.3,Accuracy~ Power and Speed are equivalent elements of IPSC shooting~ and are expressed in the Latin words "Diligentia~ Vis~ Celeritas" ("DVC"). A properly balanced course of fire will depend largely upon the nature of the challenges presented therein. However~ courses must be designed~ and IPSC matches must be conducted in such a way~ as to evaluate these elements equally. IPSC Action Air matches are exempt from minimum power considerations (also see Rule 5.6.1).,c1018bf9-b7a4-48e7-8243-24029af89306,c83ed8fc-94f3-4151-aa1b-63f2e45ec53f

RULE,cea7d943-504c-4402-8b14-f9c4929e9061,Freestyle,1.1.5,IPSC matches are freestyle. Competitors must be permitted to solve the challenge presented in a freestyle manner and~ for handgun matches~ to shoot targets on an "as and when visible" basis. After the Start Signal~ courses of fire must not require mandatory reloads nor dictate a shooting position~ location or stance~ except as specified below. However~ conditions may be created~ and barriers or other physical limitations may be constructed~ to compel a competitor into shooting positions~ locations or stances.,c1018bf9-b7a4-48e7-8243-24029af89306,c83ed8fc-94f3-4151-aa1b-63f2e45ec53f
